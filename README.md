## Development

The site runs with [Next](https://nextjs.org/). Therefore, it uses Node.js (version 14). It is recommended to install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)) to manage Node versions, but itâ€™s not mandatory, as long as Node 14 is installed on the machine.

Then run the following commands to install the local dependencies and start the development server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Tests

Unit tests are authored and ran with Jest, while end-to-end tests are executed via Cypress.

```sh
npm test
npx cypress open
```

## CMS

To run the CMS locally, make sure you [have Yarn installed](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) then:

```sh
cd cms
yarn
npm start
```

For the preview to work locally, both the local website and the local CMS need to run with the same `SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_TOKEN` environment variable. Set it in `.env` for the Next app, and run the `npm start` command of the CMS passing it the environment variable:

```sh
SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_TOKEN=YourValueHere npm start
```

## Bot

For the bot to work properly on a Discord server, it requires:

- A #trivia channel for the `!trivia` command.
- A #stormbot channel for all the other commands.
- Ideally some of the roles: Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Iron, Starter, Swarm, Shadowfen, Ironclad, Winter, Neutral, Tournamentee, Artist and Streambound.
