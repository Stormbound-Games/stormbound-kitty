# Discord Bot

## Development

The bot can be run locally on Kittyâ€™s personal Discord server to test the code before deploying it to production. First, ensure you have a valid [Discord token](https://discordhelp.net/discord-token) set in your `.env` file (`DISCORD_TOKEN`), then run the following command:

```sh
npm run bot:dev
```

## Deployment

The bot is automatically deployed on Heroku with every commit that gets pushed to the `main` branch. This environment is named [stormbound-kitty-bot](https://github.com/sheepyard/stormbound-kitty/deployments/activity_log?environment=stormbound-kitty-bot) on GitHub.

## Setup

To set up the bot on a new Discord server, follow the [typical process](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html#inviting-your-bot) to invite it. Then, run the `bot/setup.sh` script passing it the Discord server (guild) ID. It will require a [jsonbin](https://jsonbin.org/) authentication token from Kitty.

```sh
JSONBIN_TOKEN=<token> GUILD_ID=<guild id> bot/setup.sh
```

### Requirements

For the bot to work properly on a Discord server, it requires:

- A #trivia channel for the `!trivia` command.
- A #stormbot channel for all the other commands.
- Ideally some of the roles: Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Iron, Starter, Swarm, Shadowfen, Ironclad, Winter, Neutral, Tournamentee, Artist and Streambound.
