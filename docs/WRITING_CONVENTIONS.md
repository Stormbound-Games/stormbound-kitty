# Writing Conventions

## Locale

Stormbound-Kitty, like Stormbound itself, uses American English over British English. There are [subtle differences](https://www.britishcouncilfoundation.id/en/english/articles/british-and-american-english) between the two languages. The most relevant ones for our project are:

- Words with an ending similar to “vitalize” are spelled with a “z”.
- Words with an ending similar to “defense” are spelled with a “s”.
- Words with an ending similar to “color” are spelled without a “u”.
- The word “canceled” is spelled with a single ”l”.

## Capitalization

- Unit types (e.g. Feline) and modifiers (i.e. Ancient, Hero and Elder) should be capitalized.

## Card abilities

- An ability should never end with a full stop, no matter whether it is made of several sentences.
- The word “all” should be omitted when possible as it is implied.
- The term “on the board” should be omitted as it is implied.
- The term “to fight for x” should be omitted as it is implied.
- The term “itself” should be preferred over “this”.
- The term “Before attacking” should be preferred over “When attacking”.

### Pluralization

- Pluralization rules should be respected as much as possible. This might mean adapting the text depending of amounts, such as “1 unit”, “2 units”.
- The words “damage” and “strength” are never pluralized.

### Highlighting

Highlighting is made using Markdown-like syntax, by wrapping a segment of text with asterisks. In card abilities, the following rules are followed:

- Main actions should be highlighted (i.e. “build”, “command”, “confuse”, “convert”, “deal”, “deconfuse”, “decrease”, “destroy”, “disable”, “drain”, “draw”, “explode”, “fly”, “force”, “freeze”, “gain”, “give”, “increase”, “jump”, “move”, “play”, “poison”, “pull”, “push”, “remember”, “remove”, “restore”, “return”, “set”, “spawn”, “spend”, “split”, “teleport”, “trigger”, “vitalize”).
- Amounts (whether variadic or not) should be highlighted with their unit (e.g. “1/2/3/4/5 strength”, “1 unit”, “1/2/3/4/5 damage”, etc.).
- The words “bordering” and “surrounding” should be highlighted.
