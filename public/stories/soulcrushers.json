Now who’s with me!”\n    Been waiting to hear that for years. Captain Ryezis is fearless. It’s all I ever wanted to do. Kill savage toads and vile ravens. Their kind makes me sick. They cannot form anything good in this world. They have only destroyed. 12 years. 12 years of raids. 12 years of despair. 12 years of “mum would have been proud”. Now I get to have my revenge. It’s my turn to slaughter.\n    I see it. The flying creature.\n    C’mon! I’m gonna rip out your throat!\n    I lunge, it dodged.\n    Is that all you’ve got?\n    Its dead silent\n    Magic bursts from the wand\n    Block with shield, riposte.\n    You’re done for ma-\n    Pointless\n    Void\n    What the hell am I doing here. I’m going to die\n    God has abandoned us\n    The captain has sent me here to die\n    -te\n    Feathers fly. Green light explodes from the wand\n    Blood, I’m hit\n    Y-you. Y-you hit m-me.\n    Can’t feel fingers\n    Fuzzy\n    Everything’s fuzzy\n    This is it\n    It’s the end\n    There is no light\n    B-but w-why?\n    I-don’t want to go. I c-can’t.\n    *Only black.*",
