  "content": "When Edrik needs a temporary defense circuit, or perhaps a small police force, this is his answer. Most fielding knights will be placed in the Militia at some point, but most members of this less-than-esteemed force are citizens of the islands, looking for glory or wages. They’re cheap and easy to train, they’re plentiful, bordering expendable, but as a force by themselves, they’re rather weak. Take after Edrik. The militia is great for small problems, but they won’t last you forever.",
