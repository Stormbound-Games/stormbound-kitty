Runs through our veins as it kills us slowly. Armor isn’t needed when we know we’re gonna be good as dead in a blink. It’s too warm, anyways.\n    They make fun of us for how we… we were born. Our bodies don’t like this crap, does they? Nah. But yet, we must drink. We’re all gonna be moribund onna these moons.\n    Ey, don’t cry, hun. You’ll be hiccup just fine.\n    Fine with the rest of us.\n    Now drink up.",
