          Hey there! I‚Äôm Kitty. I created Stormbound-Kitty in March 2019
          (although it did not have a name yet at that point), wanting to do
          something with the beautiful artwork of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the overwhelmingly positive support from the community
          (that‚Äôs you), I kept working on the site, adding more tools, solving
          more problems and all in all enhancing players‚Äô experience outside of
          the game itself. I certainly did not expect the site to become what it
          had become over the last year or so. And if it is what it is today, it
          is essentially thanks to you, kind member of the Stormbound community.
        </p>

        <p>
          In June 2020, I also created a Discord bot for the official Stormbound
          Discord server, which is kind of an extension of the site for Discord,
          giving access to most of the tools directly from Discord, as well as a{' '}
          <Link to='/trivia'>Stormbound trivia game</Link>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As of July 2020, Stormbound-Kitty is also the official platform for{' '}
          <Link to='/releases'>release notes</Link> as well as some other
          Sheepyard-provided support.
        </p>

          <h2>Financial support</h2>

          <p>
            Working on the website and the bot takes a lot of my time, time I
            cannot spend with family, friends or my cats. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I
            love this project to bits, and I invest in it because I feel like it
            and want to. That being said, having financial support can allow me
            devote more time without feeling guilty and helps cover minor costs
            such as hosting, tracking-less analytics and domain names.
          </p>

          <h2>Non-financial support</h2>

          <p>
            If you do not want or simply cannot afford a financial contribution
            to Stormbound-Kitty, fear not! There are plenty of ways for you to
            contribute without spending a cent:

            <li>
              We have plenty <Link to='/deck/featured'>featured decks</Link>,
              but it‚Äôs sometimes hard to maintain that collection up to date
              with the meta. If you could point out which decks should be
              removed because no longer competitive, that would be helpful!
            </li>

            <li>
              The <Link to='/calculators/value'>value calculator</Link> is
              pretty experimental. Some cards have questionable results, and{' '}

                some cards are not implemented

              at all. It would be great to have help figuring out how to best
              compute the value of some cards.

              <Link to='/guides'>Guides</Link> tend to be outdated as time goes
              by and the game gets updated. Having them reviewed every now and

              helpful for people relying on these guides.
