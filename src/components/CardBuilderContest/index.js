            Submissions should be in the form of a link to the{' '}
            <Link to='/card'>card builder</Link> or to an image of your card on
            a hosting service such as imgur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Submissions can be made as soon as the week’s theme is announced
            (typically on Mondays) until the next Friday at 11:59pm (23:59) CDT.
            Please note that the cutoff time may not be the same in your
            timezone, so it’s recommended to make your submission early.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following day, the judges will decide on their top 3-5 cards
            (depending on the amount of entries). The results will be made
            available Saturday and voting will commence immediately. Voting will
            last until Sunday at 11:59pm (23:59) CDT and will be held on
            strawpoll. The winner will be announced along with the theme for the
            next competition as one post, beginning the cycle once more.

              Card submissions must be made by Friday 11:59 pm (23:59) CDT.

              Card submissions must adhere to the weekly theme. Cards that do
              not follow the theme will not be considered for voting, no matter
              how cool they may be.

            <li>
              Cards do not need all of their values filled. If you do not know
              what value would best suit the card, a variable (like ∆) is always
              fine.
            </li>

            <li>
              Card art does not need to be present for submissions, and does not
              need to be original artwork. You are allowed to use any image as
              long as it is appropriate. You know exactly what appropriate
              means.

            <li>
              Only 1 card may be submitted per person, unless otherwise
              specified by the weekly rules/theme. Submissions can be edited
              before the deadline by revisiting the google form.
            </li>

            <li>
              Cards MUST be kept secret from others, including judges and
              non-participants until the submission period has ended.

              Only 1 vote is allowed per person. Participants and
