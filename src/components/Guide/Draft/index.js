        Draft was added early 2022 as a new game mode which, unlike Brawl, is
        made for everyone by putting every player on a level-playing field,
        regardless of their Fortress Level or card collection.

      <p>
        In a nutshell, the draft mode is an event where players compete in a
        series of matches with a unique deck that gets “drafted” specifically
        for the event. Cards may get swapped or upgraded after every match,
        leading to previously unseen decks and hopefully some different
        strategies from your typical ladder gameplay.
      </p>

      <p>
        The draft runs weekly from Monday to Wednesday (therefore without
        overlap with the Brawl). Each player is able to play up to 3 draft
        “sessions” in order to get rewards during that timeframe. After which,
        it is still possible to play draft mode until the event ends, but
        without rewards — just for fun (while still earning coins for victories,
        as usual).
      </p>

      <p>
        A session ends when the player wins 6 matches or loses 3 times, which
        ever comes first, leading to sessions lasting between 3 and 8 matches.
      </p>

        Only players with at least 11 base health can participate in the draft
        mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        A draft session costs 1 “entry card”. Entry cards are special resources
        which are necessary to start a draft session. A player can have a
        maximum of 3 entry cards at a given time — that’s the upper cap for that
        resource and they do not expire so they can be saved from one week to
        the next. Entry cards can be obtained the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An entry card can be collected freely once a week by watching an ad in
          the card shop tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          Entry cards can be bought for a few dollars. One entry card +{' '}
          <Coins amount={100} /> costs $2.99, two entry cards +{' '}
          <Coins amount={300} /> for $4.99.
        </li>
        <li>
          An entry card can be skipped altogether by paying{' '}
          <Coins amount={600} /> to start a draft session.
        </li>
      </ul>

        player.
      </p>

      <Title id='matchmaking'>Matchmaking</Title>

      <p>
        Players are matched based on the amount of battles they have done within
        their session. So players having fought 1 time will be matched with
        other players having fought only 1 match so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pools widen for higher number of matches to make sure players can
        find opponents: so players played 5, 6 or 7 times are all in the same
        matchmaking pool.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is important because the base health grows throughout matches
        (regardless of their outcome). All players start at 10 base health, and
        every match increases it by 1. This means the base health can never go
        above 17 (for the last match).
      </p>

      />

      <Title id='drafting-a-deck'>Drafting a deck</Title>

      <p>
        Drafting a deck is done at the beginning of the draft session and
        consists of picking a total of 12 cards, each time from a set of 3
        different options.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cards are always drafted at level 1, and all cards from the game can be
        drafted, regardless whether the player owns them or not. This truly puts
        all players on a level-playing field.
      </p>

      <p>The draws happen in that order:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <Legendary amount={3} /> from different factions, resulting in a
          faction choice
        </li>
        <li>
          <Epic amount={3} /> from your faction, resulting in an archetype
          choice
        </li>
        <li>
          <Rare amount={3} /> with a mana cost of 3- from faction + neutral
        </li>
        <li>
          <Rare amount={3} /> with a mana cost of 4- from faction + neutral
        </li>
        <li>
          <Rare amount={3} /> from faction + neutral
        </li>
        <li>
          <Rare amount={3} /> from faction + neutral
        </li>
        <li>
          <Common amount={3} /> with a mana cost of 3- from faction + neutral
        </li>
        <li>
          <Common amount={3} /> with a mana cost of 4- from faction + neutral
        </li>
        <li>
          <Common amount={3} /> from faction + neutral
        </li>
        <li>
          <Common amount={3} /> from faction + neutral
        </li>
        <li>
          <Epic amount={3} /> from faction + neutral
        </li>
        <li>
          <Legendary amount={3} /> from the neutral faction
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Note that for all rolls where the pool of cards is the current faction +
        the neutral faction, there will be at least one card from your faction,
        and at least one neutral card amongst the 3. This makes sure a roll
        doesn’t offer 3 neutral or 3 faction cards.

      <Title id='leveling-up-cards'>Leveling up cards</Title>

      <p>
        With every match, it is possible to refine the deck to make it more
        competitive. Regardless of the outcome of a match, it offers the ability
        to level up 3 cards from the deck.
      </p>

      <p>
        Which cards can be upgraded is also drafted. That means each upgrade
        gets picked amongst 3 cards. There is also some logic to avoid the same
        card being upgraded on a loop while all other cards stay level 1. So all
        in all, the deck should improve somewhat uniformly throughout a session.
      </p>

      <Title id='replacing-cards'>Replacing cards</Title>

      <p>
        Losing a match also provides the ability to replace a card from the
        deck. Because of the 3 loss limit, it is only possible to replace 2
        cards in total.
      </p>

      <p>
        Which card to replace is entirely up to the player, so any of the 12
        cards can be discarded. In exchange, 3 level 1 cards from the same
        rarity get offered as options. This means replacing a leveled-up card
        will still yield a level 1 card.
