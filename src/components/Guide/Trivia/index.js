        Stormbound, like many games is full of a little pieces of trivia. Some
        are very well known like which cards refer to whom, and some are a bit
        more eccentric. Find below a list of all known trivia:

        Paladin Studios, the original studio behind Stormbound before it got

      </ul>

      <Title id='loading-texts'>Loading texts</Title>

      <p>
        Some cards from the game—most of which are legendary—have some trivia
        texts that are displayed during loading time when queuing for a game.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='N8' />: As a child, he started his collection with toys
          and rocks. Now, he is gathering wealth and warriors.

      <p>
        Additionally, the following card has a loading text despite not being a
        legendary card:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='S29' />: Holds a scroll of wisdom which is said to say:

      <p>
        On the other hand, the following legendary cards do not have a loading
        text (yet): <CardLink id='N59' />, <CardLink id='N69' />,{' '}
        <CardLink id='N76' />, <CardLink id='N77' /> and <CardLink id='I29' />.
      </p>

      <Title id='animated-ui-elements'>Animated UI elements</Title>

      <p>
        Some interface elements, such as Edrik the Fierce on the home screen, or
        some background islands in the desktop version of the game, can be
        clicked/tapped to show a little animation.
      </p>

      <Title id='quests'>Quests</Title>

      <p>
        Many of the quests in the game are simple and easy to understand.
        However, there are some interesting cases when completing any quest that
        requires you to <em>spawn token units</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Usually, spawning tokens involve token units. There are token units for
        every single race in the game. But what happens when you are spawning
        structures or even copies of non-vanilla cards?{' '}
        <Link to='/members/pepegak'>Pepegak</Link> discovered these notable
        scenarios:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='I22' /> respawning at your base counts as spawning a
          token.
        </li>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='I29' /> being triggered by <CardLink id='I2' /> and
          spawning on the board counts as spawning a token.
        </li>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='W29' /> spawning a copy of itself counts as spawning a
          token.
        </li>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='W13' /> spawning a <CardLink id='N13' /> counts as
          spawning a token.
        </li>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='I24' /> spawning a <CardLink id='I14' /> counts as
          spawning a token.
        </li>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='N90' /> splitting up into multiple copies of itself does{' '}
          <em>not</em> count as spawning a token.
        </li>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='F29' /> restoring a missing unit or structure does{' '}
          <em>not</em> count as spawning a token.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <Link to='/members/arthisroo'>ArthisRoo</Link> and{' '}
        <Link to='/members/troxyz'>Troxyz</Link> from Discord took some time to
        calculate the acceleration due to gravity in Stormbound (or rather, on
        Stormbound islands).

            <p>
              To do so, they used some in-game graphics as a scale, such as the
              hippo we can see in one of the pool. The average length of a hippo
              is about 4.25m. For the vertical scale, they used a human knight
              with an average height of 1.7m. Based on that, they realised that{' '}
              <span className='Highlight'>every tile is 5x5m wide</span>{' '}
              (provided they are squares).
            </p>

            <p>
              Then, they needed to compute the angle of elevation, since the
              board is not seen directly from above, but slightly from the side.
              Based on the distortion of the vertical scale relative to the
              forward scale, they got an{' '}
              <span className='Highlight'>
                angle of perspective of 55.48 degrees
              </span>{' '}
              from the horizontal.

            Then, they needed to figure out how fast toads from{' '}
            <CardLink id='F8' /> fall from a particular height. They could not
            use the animation of the toad falling since it is already falling at
            terminal velocity. Instead, they took the animation of the toad
            bouncing and falling back down. They found the peak height of the
            toad bounce to be 5.577m vertically, and it took 0.115s to fall that
            distance from rest.
