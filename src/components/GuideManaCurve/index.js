        Making an efficient deck from a mana standpoint is not that trivial
        however. There are a lot of things to take into consideration, and it is
        sometimes difficult to assess the effect of a card and its cost on the
        overall deck.

              mana onwards.

      <h3>The mana line</h3>

      <p>
        The mana line (in{' '}
        <span style={{ color: 'rgb(57, 133, 175)' }}>blue</span>) represents the
        likelihood of spending all the available mana. As the game progresses
        and the allocated mana becomes greater, it becomes less and less likely
        to be able to spend it all. This is because at some point, one has too
        much mana for the cards in hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best—not to mention theoretical—mana line is a horizontal line at
        the 100% mark. That would mean spending all the available mana on every
        turn of the game without having any leftover at any turn, regardless of
        how long the game lasts. The only card in the game making it possible to
        spend an infinite amount of mana is Lady Rime, and it is a) impossible
        to have her at every turn and b) not taken into consideration in this
        simulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong className='Highlight'>
          The ideal mana line stays high for as long as possible.
        </strong>{' '}
        The higher it stays, the most mana is being used every turn, which
        translates into better board control or speed.
      </p>

      <Guide.FullWidth padding='120px'>

              In the graph <Only.Desktop>on the right</Only.Desktop>
              <Only.Mobile>below</Only.Mobile>, the mana line is steady and very
              high in the first 5 turns, which is very good. It means the first
              few turns will almost always use all the available mana, which is
              what one would want.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we see that starting turn mana 8, the likelihood of
              having too much mana is getting greater and greater. This is
              indicative of a{' '}

              spiky. This is a bad sign, as it means one turn out of two will
              have a high chance of wasting some (possibly a lot) of mana.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is virtually no way to spend all mana on the first turn,
              which is not great. The 2nd turn, at 4 mana, is actually great,
              with virtually no way <em>not</em> to spend all mana. Turn 5
              however, which is a critical turn to assert board dominance, is
              fragile and subject to randomness.

      <h3>The cards line</h3>

      <p>
        The cards line (in{' '}
        <span style={{ color: 'var(--affordable)' }}>green</span>) represents
        the likelihood of playing all 4 cards from the hand in a given turn. It
        is impossible for it to be non-null on the 3-mana turn since it would
        imply one or more of the 4 cards cost 0 mana (which can happen in Brawl
        as we will see later). As the game progresses and the allocated mana
        becomes greater, it becomes more and more likely to be able to play all
        4 cards from the hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        There again, the best and theoretical cards line is straight and
        sticking to the 100% line, since it would imply being able to play the
        full hand on every turn of the game, since the very beginning of the
        game.

          The ideal cards line gets high as quick as possible.

        This translates into playing a lot of cards, which is usually critical
        for board control and speed.

              for just a few turns, then starts going up increasingly fast.
            </p>
            <p>
              By turn mana 7, it becomes possible—albeit unlikely—to play the
              full hand. Every turn from there makes it more and more likely to
              be able to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              From turn mana 10 on, the chances of being able to play all 4
              cards are passing over 50% and reach over 90% by turn 13, which
              might potentially be a little late depending on the randomness of
              the cards.

              In the graph <Only.Desktop>on the left</Only.Desktop>

              on turn mana 7, and jumps to the 40% mark by turn mana 8 thanks to
              Gift of the Wise which grants free mana. This makes it more likely
              to be able to play all cards on that turn and the subsequent ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              It increases relatively slowly, as the ability to play all these
              expensive cards truly relies on Gift of the Wise to begin with. In
              a deck like this, turn mana 8 is decisive and likely make or break
              for the game. That’s why the simulation never cycles Gift of the
              Wise at turn mana 7 if it is in the hand.

      <p>
        It is important to remember that this data visualisation is still just
        an approximation of the real picture. A game of Stormbound involves many
        different mechanics which cannot be efficiently represented with a
        simplistic algorithm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are the mechanics that <em>are</em> currently implemented in the
        representation of the mana curve:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cycling the most expensive card when there is not enough mana to play
          the full hand. While this is a little reductive, cycling the card with
          the highest mana cost is not an uncommon move, especially in early
          game where board control is critical.
        </li>
        <li>
          <CardLink id='W12' /> and <CardLink id='W19' /> granting mana. Both of
          these cards have been properly implemented, and their mana gain is
          taken into account in the evaluation of these chances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not cycling Gift of the Wise at turn mana 7 to make for high-value
          combos at turn mana 8. There again, maybe a little reductive as this
          is situational, but for heavy/mana-ramp decks, having Gift of the Wise
          at turn mana 8 is quite critical to come back from an early push and
          take the board back.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cards which cannot be played on the first turn. This includes{' '}
          <CardLink id='W1' />, <CardLink id='N9' />, <CardLink id='N63' /> and{' '}
          <CardLink id='S10' /> due to lack of enemies, as well as{' '}
          <CardLink id='F4' />, and other potions (which are cheapened in Brawl)
          due to lack of friendly units.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This leaves us with the following mechanics yet to be implemented for a
        more accurate depiction of the mana curve: Frozen Core and Dawnsparks
        for mana-ramp Winter decks; Counselor Ahmi for Satyr decks; pirates and
        particularly Freebooters; Collector Mirz and Harvesters of Souls for
        larger-than-12 decks; and finally Archdruid Earyn for free plays.

        A certain amount of Brawls decrease the mana cost of some cards (

              is pretty astonishing, because both lines almost intersect on turn
              mana 6, which is incredibly early due to Gift of the Wise only
              costing 6 mana in that Brawl.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means on turn mana 6, it is likely to have played all cards{' '}
              <em>and have leftover mana</em>. Other notable point is that it is
              already possible—although very unlikely—to play all 4 cards at

      <p>
        This graph relies on being able to compute the odds of being able to
        spend all available mana, and to play all cards on a single turn. It
        then determine these odds for every turn from 3 until one of them reach
        its extreme (0% for the mana line, 100% for the cards line).
      </p>

      <p>
        For a given turn, it computes all the possible unique hands there can be
        for the deck, which yields 495 sequences of 4 cards. For each hand it
        checks whether it is possible to spend all mana. If it is not because
        there is not enough mana, it cycles the most expensive card (with the
        exception of Gift of the Wise at turn mana 6). From there, it gets 8 new
        hands, and see how many can spend all mana. Eventually, we get to
        retrieve how many hands out of the initial 495 can spend all the
        available mana on a given.
      </p>

      <p>
        Computing the chances of being able to play all 4 cards are very
        similar, and takes account cycling in the same way.
