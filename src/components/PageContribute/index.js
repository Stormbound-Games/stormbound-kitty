          Working on the website and the Discord bot takes a lot of my time,
          time I cannot spend with my family, friends or my cats. Don‚Äôt get me
          wrong, I love this project to bits, and I invest in it because I feel
          like it and want to. That being said, having support from the
          community allows me to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Devote more time to it without feeling guilty thanks to{' '}

          </li>
          <li>
            Spend less time doing maintenance work thanks to{' '}
            <Link href='#non-financial-support'>non-financial support</Link>.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            Financial contributions help cover minor costs such as hosting,
            privacy-oriented analytics and domain names, as well as generally
            allowing me to spend more time working on the site during my free
            time.

          <p>
            If you do not want or simply cannot afford a financial contribution
            to Stormbound-Kitty, fear not! There are plenty of ways for you to
            contribute without spending a cent:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              We have plenty <Link to='/decks'>featured decks</Link>, but it‚Äôs
              sometimes hard to maintain that collection up to date with the
              meta. If you could point out which decks should be removed because
              no longer competitive, that would be helpful!
            </li>

            <li>
              <Link to='/guides'>Guides</Link> tend to be outdated as time goes
              by and the game gets updated. Having them reviewed every now and
              then ensures the information they contain remains valuable and
              helpful for people relying on these guides.
            </li>

            <li>
              People really like <Link to='/puzzles'>Stormbound puzzles</Link>,
              but not many are being added. If you would like to suggest new
              puzzles, I‚Äôm sure that would make a lot of people happy!
            </li>

            <li>
              The <Link to='/list/equals'>Equals Tier List</Link> needs to be
              updated on a monthly basis to reflect balance changes. We tend to
              only update it every few months, which makes it less useful, so
              feel free to help improving it!
            </li>

            <li>
              The <Link to='/calculators/value'>value calculator</Link> is
              pretty experimental. Some cards have questionable results, and{' '}
              <Link to='/faq#value-calculator'>
                some cards are not implemented
              </Link>{' '}
              at all. It would be great to have help figuring out how to best
              compute the value of some cards.
            </li>
