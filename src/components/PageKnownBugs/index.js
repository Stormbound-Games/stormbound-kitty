            Software development is not infallible, and honest mistakes,

                When already in the game when the Brawl starts on Thursday or
                the season resets on the 1st of the month at the same time, one
                might see:{' '}

                </li>
                <li>
                  In the case of the Brawl page, the Dragon Brawl is displayed,
                  but the image is a white square instead of Eloth the Ignited
                  and the leaderboard shows an ever-lasting loading state.

              </ul>

              <h3>Workaround</h3>
              <p>
                This is only a data fetching issue causing the fallback data to
                be displayed. It has no incidence on a player’s account and will
                be “resolved” with a simple game restart.

            <div>
              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                From the very beginning of the game, all animations are played
                twice. From the “Your turn”/“Opponent’s turn” one, to the
                on-play card display, to the actual 3D animation: they all play
                once, then a second time right away. The card history also
                display cards as if they were played twice.
              </p>

              <p>
                This happens when two players mutually invite themselves at the
                same time for a friendly match. Because of two parts of the
                server-side code not being aware of each other, all animations
                are played twice.
              </p>

              <h3>Workaround</h3>
              <p>
                Closing and restarting the game to join the same match again
                does not appear to fix the problem, as it seems like a
                server-side bug. The match should be abandoned and restarted,
                making sure only one of the two players invite the other.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                Occasionally, players are awarded resources without doing
                anything specific, such as for nerf compensations for instance.
                Upon opening the game, the resources animations are played (once
                per card), but then the numbers in the resource panel at the top
                of the screen are not updated.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is due to the fact that these animations do not cause the
                resource panel to refetch the actual data, therefore it still
                displays the previous numbers. The resources have been
                successfully credited to the account though on the server, but
                are not reflected on the client.
              </p>

              <h3>Workaround</h3>
              <p>
                Moving to a view that does not display resources (such as deck
                collection) to the home screen again should fix it since it
                would cause the panel to fetch the actual data. Otherwise
                restarting the game should do it.

            <div>
              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                After opening the game and jumping into a match, cycling a card
                takes the card out of the hand but does not bring a card back.
                From there, every turn grants only 3 cards in total, causing the
                game to be a disaster.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is unclear why this happens and it is believed the reason
                it has never been fixed is because it is hard to reproduce
                consistently. This seems to happen only on the first game after
                opening the game or changing decks, so probably some missing
                data.
              </p>

              <h3>Workaround</h3>
              <p>
                There is no known fix over than closing the game and reopening
                it. The match can safely be joined again, and the hand should
                contain 4 cards.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                It is possible to be invited to a friendly match despite not
                being in the “Friends” tab of the game or the home screen, such
                as the deck builder for instance.
              </p>

              <p>
                This happens when quickly entering and exiting the Friends tab,
                resulting in being marked “Online” for a few seconds despite
                having left that screen.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is likely due to the player’s status update being
                asynchronous and having to reach the server before being
                redispatched to online friends.
              </p>

              <h3>Workaround</h3>

              <p>
                It is not such a problematic bug per se. The invite can be
                accepted or declined normally, and the match would work as any
                other. In case the current deck is incomplete, it falls back
                with a complete deck from the collection.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                From time to time, it might not be possible to watch an ad to
                increase the reward after having won a game. Something similar
                might be experienced in the shop where it is not possible to
                watch an ad to get the daily Humble book.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is not clear why this happens or what causes it, as it seems
                pretty random all in all.
              </p>

              <h3>Workaround</h3>
              <p>
                Most of the time, restarting the game entirely is enough to
                resolve the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                If it persists, reseting the “ads ID” might be necessary. To do
                so:

              <p>
                The friend list sometimes display empty slots, and these tend to
                move back and forth on scroll. It does not seem to be replacing
                any actual tile though; it feels more like an off-by-one error.
              </p>

              <h3>Workaround</h3>

              <p>
                Leaving the friend list view and opening it again is usually
                enough to restore the proper display.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                It may happen that there is an “on-death” floating skull at the
                bottom left corner of the board. Attempting to{' '}
                <Only.Desktop>click</Only.Desktop>
                <Only.Mobile>tap</Only.Mobile> the skull will pop-up the Tegor
                card.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly enough, the skull appears precisely at coordinates
                [-1, -1] of the grid. This might be because of the C#{' '}
                <code>indexOf</code> method returning -1 when an entry is not
                found in an array.
              </p>

              <h3>Workaround</h3>
              <p>
                The bug being very minor and generally inoffensive, there is no
                workaround.
