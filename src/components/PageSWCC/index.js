        <p>
          Breaking any of the rules from this page will result in your current
          submission being deemed invalid. If you change your submission by
          revisiting the form, it will once again be considered valid provided
          it doesn’t break any other rule.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ability must be different from the previous one (or the art
          changed if the original was revealed without revealing the ability) in
          order to be considered valid.
        </p>

        <Title>Creating your card</Title>
        <p>
          It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> that you use the{' '}
          <Link to='/card'>card builder</Link> to create your cards, as it
          closely resembles what your card would look like in the game. It also
          allows you to copy and paste a link to the card which is required to
          submit it for the competition.
        </p>

        <p>
          When doing so, please use the “Share card” button. Make sure to select
          “Link only” in the “What to copy” field so it does not include the
          card stats as only the link is needed for the submission.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you do not use the card builder to create your submission, you can
          upload your image to a hosting website such as imgur and share that
          link instead.
        </p>

        <Title id='submitting-your-card'>Submitting your card</Title>
        <p>
          Submissions should be in the form of a link to the{' '}
          <Link to='/card'>card builder</Link> or to an image of your card on a
          hosting service such as imgur. The form will not allow submissions of
          other types because they do not always work. If you are submitting
          from your phone: do not copy and paste a link from your pictures
          folder/album, it will not load and you will be disqualified unless you
          update your submission.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are only allowed one submission per week. However, you can edit
          your submission as many times as you like before the cutoff time. If
          you want to update the text, art or stats, you only need to reopen the
          form and it should allow you to edit your submission there.
          Alternatively, you can send a link to your updated card and send it to
          me on Discord (@TaKo_G#0373).
        </p>

        <p>
          Submissions can be made as soon as the week’s theme is announced
          (every Sunday) until Friday at 11:59pm (23:59) CDT. Please note that
          the cutoff time may not be midnight in your timezone, so it’s always
          suggested to make your submission early. I will send a reminder when
          you have 24 hours and 12 hours left to submit. The following day, the
          judges will decide on the top 3 cards of the week.
        </p>

        <Title id='community-voting'>Community voting</Title>

        <p>
          After the top cards of the week are decided, a community vote will
          open up to decide the ultimate winner. Community voting will begin on
          Sunday when the next week’s theme is announced and last for 24 hours.
          The winner will be announced on Monday.
        </p>

        <Title id='rewards'>Rewards</Title>
        <p>
          Rewards will be given out to the winners each week (on Monday or soon
          after) as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The community-voted ultimate winner will be awarded{' '}
            <Rubies amount={50} />.
          </li>
          <li>
            The runners-up as selected by the judges will be awarded{' '}
            <Rubies amount={25} />.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Title id='becoming-a-judge'>Becoming a judge</Title>
        <p>
          If you want to be a judge, just message me on Discord (@TaKo_G#0373).
          You’ll be expected to judge several cards at the end of the week. If
          we are full of judges, I can add you to a queue and you can judge in
          the following week.
        </p>

        <ul className={css(styles.rules)}>

            Card submissions must be made by Friday 11:59 pm (23:59) CDT.
          </li>

          <li className={css(styles.item)}>
            Card submissions must adhere to the weekly theme. Cards that do not
            follow the theme will not be considered for voting, no matter how
            cool they may be.
          </li>

          <li className={css(styles.item)}>
            Mixing unit types from different factions <strong>is</strong>{' '}
            allowed. A Swarm frostling or an Ironclad raven are totally
            acceptable.
          </li>

          <li className={css(styles.item)}>
            Card art does not need to be present for submissions, and does not
            need to be original artwork. You are allowed to use any image as
            long as it is appropriate. You know exactly what appropriate means.
          </li>

          <li className={css(styles.item)}>
            Only 1 card may be submitted per person, unless otherwise specified
            by the weekly rules/theme. Submissions{' '}
            <span className='Highlight'>can</span> be edited before the deadline
            by revisiting the form.
          </li>

          <li className={css(styles.item)}>
            A secondary card may be submitted alongside the first but it must be
            a token card created by the primary card, the same way Qordia’s
            nests are not collectible cards.
          </li>

          <li className={css(styles.item)}>
            Judges are not allowed to compete in the competition and should
            refrain from helping the contestants with their cards.
          </li>

          <li className={css(styles.item)}>
            Cards do not need all of their values filled. If you do not know
            what value would best suit the card, a variable (like ∆) is always
            fine.
          </li>

          <li className={css(styles.item)}>
            Cards should not be shown to people other than judges until after
            the voting is over. This is to remove bias during the community
            voting round. If you made a custom artwork, please do not share that
            either.
