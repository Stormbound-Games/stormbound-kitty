              answer:
                'Tournaments are organized by community members and yield in-game rewards such as cards and rubies. They usually face about 20 players divided in brackets, eliminating more and more of them until there is only one (or more) winner left. Some tournmanents have different rules, but they more or less all work like this.',

            {
              id: 'hosting-a-tournament',
              question: 'Who can host a tournament?',
              answer:
                'In theory, everyone can. Brzoza on Discord is responsible for the schedule. If you would like to host an event, have him invite you to a dedicated Discord server where all the event hosts organize events. In there, you will find the schedule, and will be able to talk about your ideas and get some help.',

            {
              id: 'head-count',
              question:
                'How many participants usually join an event? What kind of rewards can there be?',
              answer: (
                <>
                  <p>
                    These both depend on the kind of event, whether it’s a{' '}
                    <span className='Highlight'>Tournament</span> or a{' '}
                    <span className='Highlight'>Joust</span>.

                    Tournaments can have unlimited members, and have a prize
                    pool of about <Rubies amount={400} /> to distribute between
                    the winners. They get official media coverage, but require
                    at least 2 hosts, last longer, and are bound to a pretty
                    long schedule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jousts on the other hand are smaller (up to 32 players), can
                    be self-hosted on a short schedule and usually have less
                    pressure on them. They do not benefit from media coverage
                    and the prize pool is about <Rubies amount={160} />.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This distinction helps the hosts with experimenting more
                    with events, without having to wait months for other
                    tournaments to be hosted, and generally makes things clearer
                    for everyone.
