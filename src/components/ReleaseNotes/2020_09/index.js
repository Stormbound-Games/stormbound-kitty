          On the 1st of September, a small balance patch will{' '}
          <span className={css({ color: 'var(--light-shadowfen)' })}>
            buff 12 different cards
          </span>{' '}
          (mainly neutral). Nothing too groundbreaking but it will hopefully
          show some love to some under-appreciated cards. Without further ado,
          allow me to disclose the list of changes.
        </p>

        <Title>Neutral</Title>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='N20' /> now have 4/5/6/7/8 strength (instead of
          3/4/4/5/6).
        </p>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='N29' />
          â€™s ability now deals 1/2/2-3/3/4 damage (instead of 1/1-2/2/2-3/3),
          making it more compelling at level 5.
        </p>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='N31' /> now costs 4 mana (instead of 5). It is unclear
          whether that will increase the popularity of this card at all however.
        </p>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='N63' /> now costs 3 mana (instead of 2) and its ability
          now targets a unit with at most 4/5/6/7/8 strength.
        </p>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='N23' /> now costs 2 mana at every level (instead of 3 at
          level 1 to 3) and its ability now deals 2/3/4/5/6 damage (instead of
          2/3/4/4/5 damage).
        </p>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='N57' /> now cost 8 mana (instead of 9) and have
          6/7/9/11/13 strength (instead of 7/8/10/12/15). This might mean this
          card gets to be used outside of mana ramp decks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='N38' /> now cost 5 mana (instead of 6). Hopefully a way
          to make this interesting community-designed card more prominent in the
          meta.
        </p>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='N27' /> now have 2/3/4/5/6 strength (instead of
          1/2/3/4/5).
        </p>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='N51' /> now cost 6 mana (instead of 7) and has
          4/5/6/8/10 strength (instead of 5/7/7/10/10).
        </p>

        <Title>Ironclad</Title>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='I5' /> now has 5/6/7/8/9 strength (instead of
          4/5/6/7/8), which essentially grants it an extra turn at levels 1, 3
          and 5 (provided it does not receive other damage).
        </p>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='I3' /> now costs 2 mana at every level (instead of 3 at
          level 1 to 3) and its ability now grants 2/3/4/5/6 strength (instead
          of 2/3/4/4/5).
        </p>

        <Title>Winter</Title>

        <p>
          <CardLink id='W24' /> now has 4/5/7/8/10 strength (instead of
          4/5/6/7/8), and its ability is 1/1-2/1-2/2/2 (instead of 1 at every
          level).
        </p>
