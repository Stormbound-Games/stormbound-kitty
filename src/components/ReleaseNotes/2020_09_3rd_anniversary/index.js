          On September 18th, Stormbound is turning 3 years old. Thatâ€™s
          incredible that a prototype issued from a game-jam turned into the
          game we all like and play daily! Happy anniversary Boundy!
        </p>

        <p>
          Going against the tradition, Stormbound is the one offering gifts on
          that special occasion. On the menu, four different things, enough to
          please everyone, whether paying or non-paying player.
        </p>

        <p>
          To begin with, every player will receive a one-time bundle containing{' '}
          <Coins amount={330} />, <Rubies amount={30} /> and{' '}
          <Stones amount={3} /> as well as <Legendary amount={1} /> at random
          upon login.
