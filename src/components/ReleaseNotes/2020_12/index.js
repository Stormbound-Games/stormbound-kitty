          Who doesn‚Äôt like a good Advent Calendar full of goodies during the
          month of December? Get ready for the Stormbound Advent Calendar, named
          ‚ÄúDaily Check-in Calendar‚Äù in the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is the idea: every day of December 2020, you will be rewarded
          with a small gift provided you log into the game. Gifts vary from
          coins, rubies and fusion stones, to individual cards and even books!
          If you do not log in on a given day, that reward is lost forever, but
          you can still come back the days after for the next ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          For players who are willing to spend a few bucks into the game, you
          can buy a <span className='Highlight'>Premium Pass</span> for $9.99 to
          have additional rewards. You can buy this pass at any point in
          December and will unlock all past premium daily rewards immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important to note that the Premium pass grants{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>both</span> the free reward{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>and</span> the premium reward for every
          single day you log in.
