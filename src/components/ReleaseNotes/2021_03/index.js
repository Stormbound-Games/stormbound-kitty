        <p>
          March will introduce a brand new league: the{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>Heroes League</span>! It is an additional
          league after Diamond which can be reached on a monthly basis by
          passing beyond Diamond 1.
        </p>

        <Spacing vertical='LARGER'>
          <Image
            src='/assets/images/releases/rank_hero.png'

          />
        </Spacing>

        <p>
          This league does not have the same ranking system as the
          others‚Äîinstead it has a scoring ladder. Players move along that ladder
          based on the amount of <span className='Highlight'>Hero Crowns</span>{' '}
          they own, also known as their{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>Hero Score</span> (HS for short). Owning{' '}
          <HeroCrowns amount={1500} /> is the same as having a Hero Score of
          1500. These are gained and lost after each ranked game performed in
          Diamond and the Heroes League (see formula below).
        </p>

        <p>
          When entering the Diamond league, every player is granted{' '}
          <HeroCrowns amount={1000} /> to start with. As they progress through
          Diamond, they already collect (or lose) Hero Crowns (see calculations
          below). When finally passing Diamond 1 and entering the Heroes League,
          the amount of Hero Crowns collected represents the current Hero
          Score‚Äîprovided it is above 1000. If the Diamond progress was difficult
          and a player was to enter Heroes League with less than{' '}
          <HeroCrowns amount={1000} />, their score would be set to 1000.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          At the end of the season, players having reached the Heroes League
          will be down-ranked back to Diamond 5, their Hero Score will be reset,
          and they will receive a Heroes League chest containing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Common amount={20} /> (+6 from Diamond)
          </li>
          <li>
            <Rare amount={16} /> (+4 from Diamond)
          </li>
          <li>
            <Epic amount={8} /> (+2 from Diamond)
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>

          </li>

        <p>
          Players within the top 500 of the ladder will gain additional rewards
          as follow:
        </p>

        <ul>

          </li>

            <p>
              One thing to note is that already claimed first-time rewards (for
              achieving a new rank) will no longer show up on the reward list
              next to the rank.
            </p>

            <p>
              The release will also introduce a lot of other small UI tweaks
              here and there, as well as many bugfixes.

              answer:
                'Temple of Space will be released on February 26th, and Flameless Lizards on March 19th. The Heroes League will be available from March onwards.',

              answer:
                'No, you are either in the Diamond league or in the Heroes league, but never both. However, when you are in Diamond, you already collect Hero Crowns but your score is not taken into consideration on the Heroes league leaderboard.',

              answer:

                'Yes, the daily check-in calendar will continue in March, and can be boosted to Premium for $5 like previous months. The rewards are not finalised yet, but they will be similar to the ones from January and February.',
