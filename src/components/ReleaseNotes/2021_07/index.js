            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not

            In case you missed it, the page of every card now lists the changes
            the card went through over the years and provides a handy way to
            visualize former versions of the card, before balance patches
            happened.{' '}

            the revamp of the Brawl from June

          , this release is going to bring 4 new and very unique Brawl
          modifiers.{' '}
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to='/brawl/pure-amalgamation'>Pure Amalgamation</Link>: Both
            players are forced to play the same deck (at the same levels),
            randomly composed of 6 cards of one player and 6 cards of the other.
            No duplicates, and the strongest card copy is preferred. Say hello
            to <span className='Highlight'>multi-faction decks</span>!
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to='/brawl/fights-of-threes'>Fights of Threes</Link>: A player
            cannot place more than 3 units on the board. Therefore, this Brawl
            will encourage a careful balance of units, spells and structures to
            be successful.
            <br /> Interestingly, <CardLink id='N2' /> and <CardLink id='N50' />{' '}
            can be played but their tokens immediately get destroyed if there
            are already 3 friendly units on the board.
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to='/brawl/thin-no-mans-land'>Thin No-Man‚Äôs Land</Link>: The
            initial frontline starts on the second row instead of the first and
            cannot fall lower than the second row at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to='/brawl/stunning-attack'>Stunning Attack</Link>: Units get
            confused on receiving any damage. This Brawl should be all about
            confusion.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To celebrate these new Brawls, the Pure Amalgamation modifier will be
          issued on all difficulty levels on July 1st as a try out. Enjoy it!
        </p>

        <p>
          On the topic of Brawls, the loss counter will be replaced with a heart
          counter instead, in preparation for upcoming features.
        </p>

        <Title id='deck-slots'>Deck slots</Title>

        <p>
          After having considered the community‚Äôs opinion on the cost of the new
          deck slots, we decided to significantly reduce it to{' '}
          <Rubies amount={25} />, <Rubies amount={50} /> and{' '}
          <Rubies amount={100} />.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to make sure no one wasted resources needlessly, players who
          already bought these slots will receive compensation of course.
