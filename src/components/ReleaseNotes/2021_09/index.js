          Hello Stormbounders! A new version of Stormbound is coming early
          September, bringing balance changes, a new card, and a lot of generous
          offers to celebrate Stormbound‚Äôs 4th anniversary!
        </p>

        <p>
          Before we begin, let‚Äôs take a short moment to remember that the
          development team is currently quite fragmented due to well-deserved
          holidays in August and September, hence the releases being a little
          superficial. It will pick up some steam in October to deliver new
          exciting content soon!
        </p>

          <p>
            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not
            over, even if you have been vaccinated. You can still carry the
            disease and make people sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So wear a mask and avoid unnecessary travels‚Äîespecially if you live
            in an area with rampant COVID-19 cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort
            to slow down this pandemic. Do the right thing. üôè

        </Info>

        <Title id='balance-changes'>Balance changes</Title>

        <p>
          This release, just like any other, will bring some balance changes.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N80' />‚Äô movement is now 1 (up from 0), strength is
            now 4/5/6/7/8 (up from 3/4/5/6/7) and their ability is now
            surrounding at all levels and triggers before moving instead of on
            play only. This introduces the{' '}
            <span className='Highlight'>before moving</span> mechanic, now
            available for search in deck builder and collection manager on the
            site.
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='W22' />‚Äô ability now grants 3/4/5/6/7 (down from
            4/5/6/7/8) but is made to trigger on attack, regardless of position.
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N43' />‚Äô ability now triggers when played borderding
            at least 1 friendly dragon, instead of exactly 1 friendly dragon.
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='I24' />‚Äô strength is now 5/6/7/8/9 (up from
            4/5/6/7/8).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N77' />
            ‚Äôs ability has been revamped to synergize with pirate cards in the
            hand of both players. The new ability at level 5 reads as such: ‚ÄúOn
            play, draw 3 single-use non-pirate card copies from the enemy‚Äôs
            hand. If you have a pirate card in hand, reduce their mana cost by
            1.‚Äù
          </li>
        </ul>

        <NerfCompensationInfo ids={['N77']} spacing={{ top: 'LARGEST' }} />

        <Title id='new-card'>New card</Title>

        <p>
          A new card will be introduced on September 23rd:{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>Sparkly Kitties</span>. I am beyond
          humbled getting a card dedicated to me in the game, especially on the
          4 years anniversary mark, almost 2.5 years to the day after I launched
          Stormbound-Kitty. Thank you to the team, and thank you to the
          incredible Stormbound community.
        </p>
      </>

      </Page.Embed>

      <>
        <p>
          The reason the card is marked as having 0 movement only to gain it on
          play is to avoid a confusing (no pun intended) movement tooltip
          in-game. If it had initial movement, the arrow would show moving
          forward twice, while this would not be the outcome.
        </p>

        <Title id='anniversary-gifts'>Anniversary gifts</Title>

        <p>
          To celebrate this special event, anyone logging into the game on
          September 18th (and only that day) will receive the following bundle:{' '}
          <Coins amount={400} />, <Rubies amount={40} />, <Stones amount={4} />{' '}
          and <Legendary amount={1}>1 random legendary car</Legendary>.
        </p>

        <p>
          On top of that,{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>all coin gains will be doubled</span>{' '}
          between September 17th and September 20th , except for quests. The
          coin cap will also be doubled for that timeframe, reaching{' '}
          <Coins amount={800} /> for all players, and <Coins amount={1400} />{' '}
          for Premium Pass holders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Last but not least,{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>all books will contain more cards</span>{' '}
          between September 17th and September 20th. Books normally holding 3
          cards will be contain 4, and books usually containing 6 cards (Mythic,
          Heroic and Classic) will yield 8!
        </p>

        <Title id='cheapened-brawl'>Cheapened Brawl</Title>
        <p>
          Similar to previous events, the Brawl starting on September 16th (and
          only that one) is going to be cheaper. All fights will be 50% off.
          Owners of the Premium Pass will also have their usual discount
          applied, leading to a 60% reduction.
        </p>
        <CheapenedBrawl ratio={0.5} />

        <Title id='exclusive-offers'>Exclusive offers</Title>

        <p>
          For those of you willing to put a few bucks into the game and
          supporting the creators, this anniversary event will introduce 4
          special in-app purchases. They will all be available for a week from
          September 13th.

          <p>
            Please note that the books granted by the following offers will
            yield the <span className='Highlight'>normal amount of cards</span>,
            and no more. Extra cards in tomes will be exclusive to those that
