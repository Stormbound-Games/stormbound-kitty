          Hello Stormbounders! A new version of Stormbound is coming early
          October, bringing balance changes, new ancient cards, some generous
          offers and new Brawl modifiers!
        </p>

        <p>
          Before we begin, let‚Äôs take a short moment to remember that the
          development team is currently quite fragmented due to well-deserved
          holidays in September, hence the releases being a little superficial.
          It will pick up some steam in October again to deliver new exciting
          content soon!
        </p>

            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not

          There will be 4 new Brawl modifiers coming in October to keep things
          fresh. Most of the modifiers have been there for ages, and y‚Äôall know
          which decks to play in and out. We hope bringing more modifiers will
          keep the Brawl entertaining and rewarding!

          There will be some special weekly and monthly vanishing packs

            <p>
              To make spending a few bucks here and there into vanishing packs
              more rewarding, we are introducing a system where every vanishing
              pack purchase grants you collectible points.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Buying a <span className='Highlight'>daily</span> vanishing pack
                yields <span className='Highlight'>1 point</span>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Buying a <span className='Highlight'>weekly</span> vanishing
                pack yields <span className='Highlight'>2 points</span>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Buying a <span className='Highlight'>monthly</span> vanishing
                pack yields <span className='Highlight'>3 points</span>.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These points are used to reach 3 different milestones which yield
              additional resources. Once the third milestone has been claimed,
              all 3 milestones will get reset in the next month so they can
              eventually be collected again.
            </p>
          </Row.Column>

              extend={{ marginTop: 0 }}
            />
          </Row.Column>
        </Row>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Milestone 1 requires 5 points and yields <Coins amount={1000} />.
          </li>
          <li>
            Milestone 2 requires 10 points in total (including the previous
            milestone) and yields <Rubies amount={200} />.
          </li>
          <li>
            Milestone 3 requires 15 points in total (including the previous
            milestones) and yields <Stones amount={50} />.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          As an example, if you collect 6 points in October, you get to collect
          the reward for the first milestone. When November comes, nothing will
          get reset: you will still have 6 points, and there will still be 2
          milestones to reach. If in November you get 15 points in total, you‚Äôll
          collect the remaining 2 milestones. Then in December, your points will
          get back to 0, and the milestones will be available for collection
          again once you have enough points.
        </p>

        <p>
          An update made to vanishing packs is also that they are no longer
          limited to a single purchase for a given period (daily, weekly,
          monthly). That limit has been increased 3. So a vanishing pack can be
          bought 3 times per day/week/month.

                    What happens depends on whether there is 0, 1 or 2 available

                      If both side cells are available, Fragmented Essences
                      split their strength (randomly if odd) into two copies,
                      and then both move forward (but not split until next

                    <li>
                      If only one side cell is available, Fragmented Essences
                      splits half their strength (rounded down) there, and the

                      If no side cell are available or Fragmented Essences have
                      only 1 strength, nothing happens and they just move

              answer: (

                  Not really. Bounded Daemons will spawn every time it moves (or
                  rather, just before) while Dreadfauns only spawns on play.
                  Additionally, Bounded Daemons only spawns on lateral sides,
                  not in front or in the back, so it can move right away.

                  Yes. They can pick their own tile as a teleport target and
                  teleport there.

                  Frozen, confused, vitalized, poisoned or silenced. Same list
                  as for the new Chaos Unleashed Brawl modifier. Note that an
                  already applied status effect cannot be rolled again. So if
                  Erratic Neglects are already poisoned, they cannot roll poison
                  again before moving‚Äîonly the other status effects.
