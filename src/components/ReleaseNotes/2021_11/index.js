            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not
            over, even if you have been vaccinated. You can still carry the
            disease and make people sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So wear a mask and avoid unnecessary travels‚Äîespecially if you live
            in an area with rampant COVID-19 cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort
            to slow down this pandemic. Do the right thing. üôè

        <p>
          In October, we needed to finish a lot of things that were planned
          regarding Stormbound‚Äôs monetization. That‚Äôs why we have tweaked
          vanishing packs and in last 2 weeks you could see some great
          time-limited offers around. Right now we can fully conentrate on
          delivering features and content you‚Äôve been waiting for a long time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, you can expect the following to come in the next few
          months:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

            features to make this mode the best around.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className='Highlight'>Reworked campaign mode</span>: It will

            : We are finally ready to get Stormbound to the always desired state

              The long awaited deck import/export feature is finally coming!
              This will help players sharing decks with one another.
            </p>

            <p>
              The deck selection screen will now provide an option to export

            </p>

            <p>
              To import a deck via its code, players need to have all required
              cards in their collection. If they don‚Äôt have all of them, the
              game will inform which cards are missing.
