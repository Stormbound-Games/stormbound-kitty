          <p>
            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not
            over, even if you have been vaccinated. You can still carry the
            disease and make people sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So wear a mask and avoid unnecessary travels‚Äîespecially if you live
            in an area with rampant COVID-19 cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort
            to slow down this pandemic. Do the right thing. üôè

          The team is currently focusing most of its efforts onto the

          We are also finalizing the new authentication system to let people
          sign in with their Google account or Apple ID. It will be possible to
          merge your Kongregate account to your new account (and vice versa). As
          a result, new players will no longer have to create a Kongregate
          account.

          The day before Christmas (December 23rd), a new card will be released.
          It will join the few common cards with the ability to do chip damage!

            As usual, there will be an exclusive pack to collect early copies of
            the new card. It will cost $9.99 and bring 10 copies of the card +{' '}

        <Title id='card-upgrading-tutorial'>Card upgrading tutorial</Title>

        <p>
          Upgrading card is essential to the Stormbound experience. However, it
          is not necessarily too obvious for new players how it works.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are introducing a card upgrading tutorial for new players who have
          never upgraded any cards. The tutorial will guide them through the
          upgrading system, and will make each player have a level 2{' '}
          <CardLink id='N3' /> card at the end of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a second part of the tutorial that gives out{' '}
          <Stones amount={6} />, so players can decide themselves if they want
          to level up another common card right away or keep them for later.

        <p>
          A lot has been done to improve matchmaking over the last year, from
          algorithmic changes to base health caps. We are finally introducing a
          level cap based on the player‚Äôs league, the same way the fortress
          level cap works.
        </p>

        <ul>

            <span style={{ color: 'var(--bronze)' }}>Bronze League</span>: Card

            level capped to 3

            <span style={{ color: 'var(--gold)' }}>Gold League</span>: Card
            level capped to 3

            Card level capped to 5

            Card level capped to 5

            level capped to 5
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We hope this helps solving the matchmaking difficulties by leveling
          the play field on a per league basis.

            off. Owners of the Premium Pass will also have their usual discount
            applied, leading to a 60% reduction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Something quite unique about this Brawl will be the introduction of
            a new modifier (in all difficulties). A 0-mana cost level 1 (unless
            owned and leveled) <CardLink id='N91' /> card will be added to
            everyone‚Äôs deck (thus causing all decks to have 13 cards).
