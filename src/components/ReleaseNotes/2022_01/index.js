          <p>
            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not
            over, even if you have been vaccinated. You can still carry the
            disease and make people sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So wear a mask and avoid unnecessary travels‚Äîespecially if you live
            in an area with rampant COVID-19 cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort
            to slow down this pandemic. Do the right thing. üôè

                  Not really. If you really want to give up on your current
                  session, you can just lose matches until you‚Äôve accumulated 3
                  losses. And if you don‚Äôt finish your session before the end of
                  the event, it will be ended and you will be able to collect
                  the rewards based on the amount of matches you won.
