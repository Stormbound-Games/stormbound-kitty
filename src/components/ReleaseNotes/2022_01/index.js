        <h3 id='synopsis'>Synopsis</h3>

        <p>
          In a nutshell, the draft mode is an event where players compete in a
          series of matches with a unique deck that gets ‚Äúdrafted‚Äù specifically
          for the event. Cards may get swapped or upgraded after every match,
          leading to previously unseen decks and hopefully some different
          strategies from your typical ladder gameplay.
        </p>

        <p>
          The draft runs weekly from Monday to Wednesday (therefore without
          overlap with the Brawl). Each player is able to play up to 3 draft
          ‚Äúsessions‚Äù in order to get rewards during that timeframe. After which,
          it is still possible to play draft mode until the event ends, but
          without rewards ‚Äî just for fun (while still earning coins for
          victories, as usual).
        </p>

        <p>
          A session ends when the player wins 6 matches or loses 3 times, which
          ever comes first, leading to sessions lasting between 3 and 8 matches.

          Only players with at least 11 base health can participate in the draft
          mode.
        </p>

        <p>
          A draft session costs 1 ‚Äúentry card‚Äù. Entry cards are special
          resources which are necessary to start a draft session. A player can
          have a maximum of 3 entry cards at a given time ‚Äî that‚Äôs the upper cap
          for that resource and they do not expire so they can be saved from one
          week to the next. Entry cards can be obtained the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An entry card can be collected freely once a week by watching an ad
            in the card shop tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            Entry cards can be bought for a few dollars. One entry card +{' '}
            <Coins amount={100} /> costs $2.99, two entry cards +{' '}
            <Coins amount={300} /> for $4.99.
          </li>
          <li>
            An entry card can be skipped altogether by paying{' '}
            <Coins amount={600} /> to start a draft session.
          </li>
        </ul>

          The content of the chest retrieved at the end of a draft session
          depends on how many matches the player won, between 0 and 6 (as well
          as whether or not they own the Premium Pass). Here is the content of
          the 7 different chests:

          league of the player.
        </p>

        <h3 id='matchmaking'>Matchmaking</h3>

        <p>
          Players are matched based on the amount of battles they have done
          within their session. So players having fought 1 time will be matched
          with other players having fought only 1 match so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pools widen for higher number of matches to make sure players can
          find opponents: so players played 5, 6 or 7 times are all in the same
          matchmaking pool.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is important because the base health grows throughout matches
          (regardless of their outcome). All players start at 10 base health,
          and every match increases it by 1. This means the base health can
          never go above 17 (for the last match).
        </p>

        />

        <h3 id='drafting-a-deck'>Drafting a deck</h3>

        <p>
          Drafting a deck is done at the beginning of the draft session and
          consists of picking a total of 12 cards, each time from a set of 3
          different options.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cards are always drafted at level 1, and all cards from the game can
          be drafted, regardless whether the player owns them or not. This truly
          puts all players on a level-playing field.
        </p>

        <p>The draws happen in that order:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <Legendary amount={3} /> from different factions, resulting in a
            faction choice
          </li>
          <li>
            <Epic amount={3} /> from your faction, resulting in an archetype

        <p>
          Note that for all rolls where the pool of cards is the current faction
          + the neutral faction, there will be at least one card from your
          faction, and at least one neutral card amongst the 3. This makes sure
          a roll doesn‚Äôt offer 3 neutral or 3 faction cards.

        <h3 id='leveling-up-cards'>Leveling up cards</h3>

        <p>
          With every match, it is possible to refine the deck to make it more
          competitive. Regardless of the outcome of a match, it offers the
          ability to level up 3 cards from the deck.
        </p>

        <p>
          Which cards can be upgraded is also drafted. That means each upgrade
          gets picked amongst 3 cards. There is also some logic to avoid the
          same card being upgraded on a loop while all other cards stay level 1.
          So all in all, the deck should improve somewhat uniformly throughout a
          session.
        </p>

        <h3 id='replacing-cards'>Replacing cards</h3>

        <p>
          Losing a match also provides the ability to replace a card from the
          deck. Because of the 3 loss limit, it is only possible to replace 2
          cards in total.
        </p>

        <p>
          Which card to replace is entirely up to the player, so any of the 12
          cards can be discarded. In exchange, 3 level 1 cards from the same
          rarity get offered as options. This means replacing a leveled-up card
          will still yield a level 1 card.
        </p>

                  Not really. If you really want to give up on your current
                  session, you can just lose matches until you‚Äôve accumulated 3
                  losses. And if you don‚Äôt finish your session before the end of
                  the event, it will be ended and you will be able to collect
                  the rewards based on the amount of matches you won.
