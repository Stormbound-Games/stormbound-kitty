          <p>
            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not
            over, even if you have been vaccinated and got a booster shot. You
            can still carry the disease and make people sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So wear a mask and avoid unnecessary travels‚Äîespecially if you live
            in an area with rampant COVID-19 cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort
            to slow down this pandemic. Do the right thing. üôè

        <Title id='compensation'>Compensation</Title>

        <p>
          Over the last month, there were a few issues related to one of our
          service providers performing a framework update. This may have
          resulted in decreased performance, which was aggravated by the fact
          that the release of the Draft Mode caused more players than usual to
          play.
        </p>

        <p>
          We did our best to roll out quick fixes to bring back the game to a
          playable state, with only occasional performance drops in specific
          cases. With the community‚Äôs help, we have identified all remaining
          issues and fixed them one by one, both via backend updates and client
          releases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nevertheless, we would like to apologize for the issues you‚Äôve faced
          and issue a small gift in compensation.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            We will enable a ‚Äúdouble coin event‚Äù during the first week of
            February. Matches will yield twice as many coins, and the coin cap
            will be raised to <Coins amount={800} /> (
            <Coins amount={1400} /> for Premium Pass holders) for that week.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Brawl event for that week will be half the price (see{' '}
            <Link to='#cheapened-brawls'>Cheapened Brawls</Link> below).
          </li>
          <li>
            Every player logging into the game at least once during the first
            week of February will be granted 1 free entry card for the Draft
            mode.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <CheapenedBrawl ratio={1 / 2} title='Cheapened Brawls'>
          <p>
            The Brawl starting on February 3rd <strong>and</strong> the Brawl
            starting on Fabruary 17th are going to be cheaper. All fight will
            cost 50% of their original price.
          </p>
        </CheapenedBrawl>

          This release, just like any other, will bring some balance changes.

          Similar to what we did{' '}
          <Link to='/releases/12-2021'>back in December</Link> for{' '}
          <CardLink id='N91' />, we will introduce 4 new Brawl modifiers for the
          4 new cards. We think it‚Äôs a good way for you to be able to try, play
          with and enjoy newly added cards before you start collecting
        </p>

        <p>
          Like last time, a 0-mana level 1 (unless owned and leveled) copy of
          the new card will be added to everyone‚Äôs deck (thus causing all decks
          to have 13 cards). This will be in Warrior mode only.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Warrior Brawl starting on the February 3rd will be for{' '}
            <CardLink id='F31' />.

          <li>
            The Warrior Brawl starting on the February 17th will be for{' '}

        <Title id='valentines-event'>Valentine‚Äôs Event</Title>

        <p>
          With Valentine‚Äôs day approaching quickly, we thought we‚Äôd do a small
          event to mark the occasion. To begin with, and as mentioned before,
          the Brawl of the 17th will be half the price!
        </p>

        <p>Additionally, there will be 3 new Valentine avatars.</p>

        <p>
          Like most holiday events, there will be some one-time only special
          offers for people willing to put some money into the game. The
          Valentine exclusive packs will be available from February 8th (9AM
          CET) until Feburary 14th (end of day) so be sure to jump on them!
