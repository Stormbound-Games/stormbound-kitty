            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not
            over, even if you have been vaccinated and got a booster shot. You
            can still carry the disease and make people sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So wear a mask and avoid unnecessary travels‚Äîespecially if you live
            in an area with rampant COVID-19 cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort
            to slow down this pandemic. Do the right thing. üôè

        <p>
          Similar to what we did <Link to='/releases/02-2022'>last month</Link>,
          we will introduce 2 new Brawl modifiers for the 2 new cards. We think
          it‚Äôs a good way for you to be able to try, play with and enjoy newly
          added cards before you start collecting
        </p>

        <p>
          Like last time, a 0-mana level 1 (unless owned and leveled) copy of
          the new card will be added to everyone‚Äôs deck (thus causing all decks
          to have 13 cards). Only difference with last time is that if you also
          have that card in your base deck, it will cost 0 mana as well.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Warrior Brawl starting on the March 10th will be for{' '}

        <p>
          We are happy to introduce a handful of bug fixes as will interface
          improvements in this release, starting with the friends notifications
          toggle. When turned off, other players cannot send you invites.
