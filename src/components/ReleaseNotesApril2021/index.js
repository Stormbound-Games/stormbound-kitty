            <CardLink id='N8' /> no longer has movement (down from 1).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N79' /> now cost 3 mana (down from 5) and have
            3/4/5/6/7 strength (down from 5/6/7/9/11).
          </li>

            ‚Äôs ability now only considers each unique surrounding{' '}
            <span className='Highlight'>primary</span> unit types. For instance,{' '}
            <CardLink id='F27' /> would be considered Ravens only in such case,
            not Elders. <CardLink id='N76' /> is treated as an Elder only, not a
            Hero.

          Heroes League improvements
        </Title>

        <p>
          It was to be expected that the new Heroes League would not be the
          perfect system from the get go. We are committed to make it better,
          and are ready to bring first improvements.
        </p>

        <p>The main pain-points we collected were the following:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            There are not enough players to play with in the Heroes League,
            particularly at the start of a new season.
          </li>
          <li>The matchmaking often felt unfair and uneven.</li>
          <li>
            The <ResourceIcon resource='HERO_CROWN' /> Hero Crowns gains and
            losses after a battle often felt too high.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          As a result, here are the changes we are about to implement to
          hopefully make things better:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Because players currently in Heroes League will be downranked to
            Diamond instead of Platinum, we expect the Heroes League to fill up
            quicker than in its first month, hopefully minimizing the empty
            queues‚Äô issue.
          </li>

          <li>
            We are revisiting the way matchmaking works in order to make battles
            more balanced. The <ResourceIcon resource='HERO_CROWN' /> Hero
            Crowns will be used to match players in Heroes League, and players‚Äô
            league and cards level within their played deck will be taken into
            account in any other league.
            <br />
            As a result, we hope to build a system where gold farmers are more
            likely to be matched with other gold farmers instead of people who
            are trying to climb. Additionally, the difference in{' '}
            <ResourceIcon resource='HERO_CROWN' /> Hero Crowns in Heroes League
            matches should be lower.
          </li>

          <li>
            When a Heroes League player gets matched with a Diamond player, the
            Diamond‚Äôs player amount of <ResourceIcon resource='HERO_CROWN' />{' '}
            Hero Crowns is assumed to be 1000. This should decrease the{' '}
            <ResourceIcon resource='HERO_CROWN' /> Hero Crowns losses/gains in
            such matches.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          We hope these improvements are enough to make the Heroes League more
          enjoyable to everyone. In any case, we are going to analyze data and
          listen to your feedback within the next few weeks to see how it feels.
          We have a few other improvement ideas if needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          This has been a loooong time coming, but we are finally about to have
          a new login system. It‚Äôs not quite done yet, but we are hoping to see
          it live some time during the month of April.
        </p>

        <p>
          The new system will let people sign in with their Google account or
          Apple ID. It will be possible to merge your Kongregate account to your
          new account (and vice verse). As a result, new players will no longer
          have to create a Kongregate account.
