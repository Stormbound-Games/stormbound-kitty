        <Title id='hotfix-coming'>(Update) Hotfix coming</Title>

        <p>
          A small hotfix version is coming at the end of the first week of
          August to fix a few things from this release that were not caught
          during beta testing. Namely:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A fix for the visual glitch with Temple of Time. Only one of the
            units/structures affected by Temple of Time‚Äôs ability would show the
            corresponding particle effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            A fix for the visual glitch where losing a match with two extra
            slots‚Äîone filled and one not‚Äîwould display both of them as lost
            during the loss animation sequence (returning to Brawl selection
            screen would display the correct heart state again).
          </li>
          <li>
            A fix for the visual glitch where playing Queen of Herds with satyrs
            stolen by Rogue Sheep or Harvester of Souls would display incorrect
            card during ability animation.
          </li>
          <li>
            A fix for Rogue Sheep‚Äôs inability to copy spell cards from the
            opponent‚Äôs hand.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Title id='balance-changes'>Balance changes</Title>

        <p>This release, like any other, brings some balance changes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='W29' />
            ‚Äôs ability now considers all friendly units (instead of surrounding
            only), but affects less units at all levels (from 2/3/4/5/6 to
            1/2/2/3/3). It also attemps to spawn a 1-strength copy of itself on
            the tile behind, like a tree expanding its roots. Additionally, its
            strength has been decreased by 1 (from 3/4/5/6/7 to 2/3/4/5/6).
          </li>

          <li>
            <CardLink id='N85' />
            ‚Äôs ability still triggers at the start of the turn but now grants
            (or removes if already present) fixedly forward movement to the
            leftmost unit in the hand, then destroys the weakest confused unit
            on the board.
          </li>

          <li>
            <CardLink id='S21' />‚Äô strength is now 8/10/12/12/14 (up from
            6/8/10/10/12).
          </li>

          <li>
            <CardLink id='F20' />‚Äô strength is now 5/6/7/8/10 (up from
            3/4/5/6/8).
          </li>

          <li>
            <CardLink id='N77' /> now costs 4 mana (down from 6) and its
            strength is now 3/4/5/6/7 (up from 2/3/4/5/7). Additionally, its
            ability is reworked from scratch and activates on play instead of on
            death. It now draws up to 1/1/2/2/3 card copies from the enemy‚Äôs
            hand, and reduces the mana cost of these copies by 1. Card copies
            can be cycled like normal cards but they are single-use. They do not
            go back into the deck once they‚Äôve been played once.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Quite uniquely, <CardLink id='N77' /> owners will be compensated with
          the usual rewards despite the card being reworked and overall buffed.
          We decided to do so because you‚Äôre effectively ‚Äúlosing‚Äù a card you
          might have invested your resources in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another temple card will come early August, the Temple of Time! As its
          name might suggest, it plays with the flow of the game, restoring
          friendly units and structures to the state from the previous turn.

          As usual, there will be an exclusive pack to quickly get access to the
          new card, for a week after its release date. To celebrate Sheepyard‚Äôs
          first anniversary taking care of the game, there will also be a
          Sheepyard Pack available, as well as a Rogue Sheep pack.

          The second part of the new heart system will be introduced in late
          July in the form of Brawl winning bonuses.

        <Row isDesktopOnly>

              The idea is that after{' '}
              <span className='Highlight'>every victory</span> in Brawl, the
              player will be offered one of two random bonuses, amongst a set of
              9 different possible bonuses (see the complete list below). Some
              of them will provide resources while some will improve the
              player‚Äôs livelihood in Brawl by redeeming and refilling hearts.
            </p>
            <p>
              A player begins a Brawl adventure in the selected tier with 3 full
              green hearts (just like it is right now). When losing a match, a
              player loses one heart (it gets emptied and red). If all hearts
              are lost, then the player‚Äôs crowns get reset to the beginning of
              the current milestone.

        </CardsContainer>

        <p>Here is the breakdown of every victory bonus:</p>

        <h3>Life/Lives Up bonuses</h3>
        <p>
          Picking these bonuses will refill a heart (or all hearts), giving the
          player extra chances to climb the milestones without being reset to
          the start of the current milestone.
        </p>
        <p>These bonuses can only be found if there are hearts to refill.</p>

        <h3>Rusty Slot</h3>
        <p>
          Picking this bonus will grant the player an extra heart slot (up to 5
          heart slots in total). This heart needs to be refilled with a
          life/lives up before it can withstand a loss. Once the player loses a
          life from this slot, the slots destroys itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rusty slots also get destroyed on milestone reset (but not on
          milestone progress).
        </p>

        <h3>Slot Solidify</h3>
        <p>
          Picking this bonus will make one of the player‚Äôs rusty slots
          indestructible. From there on, it behaves like one of three default
          slots: it can withstand multiple losses (and get refilled multiple
          times), and never gets destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This bonus can only be found if the player has a rusty heart slot.
        </p>

        <h3>Ice Armor</h3>
        <p>
          Picking this bonus will give an Ice Armor to the first full heart
          (from the left). After a loss, the Ice Armor gets destroyed while
          keeping the heart beneath it intact.
        </p>
        <p>Ice Armors also get destroyed upon milestone progress.</p>

        <h3>Fortress Up bonus</h3>
        <p>
          Picking this bonus will increase the Fortress Level of the player by 1
          within the current Brawl difficulty and only for Brawl matches. It
          will not increase the Fortress Level beyond the cap for that Brawl.
          This bonus cannot be drawn if already capped.
        </p>

        <h3>Resources bonuses</h3>
        <p>
          Picking these bonuses will immediately grant the player a certain
          amount of resources, varying based on the Brawl difficulty and
          milestone.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Coins bonus can be obtained from the very first milestone
            onwards. Its rewards can go up to <Coins amount={100} /> in Casual,{' '}
            <Coins amount={250} /> in Warrior and <Coins amount={500} /> in
            Ultimate.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Rubies bonus can be obtained from milestone 3 onwards and can go
            up to <Rubies amount={25} /> in Casual, <Rubies amount={50} /> in
            Warrior and <Rubies amount={100} /> in Ultimate.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Fusion Stones can be obtained from milestone 5 onwards and bonus
            can go up to <Stones amount={3} /> in Casual, <Stones amount={10} />{' '}
            in Warrior and <Stones amount={25} /> in Ultimate.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            The <Link to='/brawl'>Brawl tracker</Link> has been updated to take

            Similar to previous events, the Brawl starting on July 29th (and

            Owners of the Premium Pass will also have their usual discount

              We are introducing a way to redeem some skipped days from the
              daily check-in calendar for both Premium and non-Premium users.
              Every day, you‚Äôll be able to redeem a skipped day reward by
              watching an ad.
            </p>

              We hope this will help players with a more sporadic involvement
              with the game to still get all the rewards they need to progress.

                  ‚ÄúCard copies‚Äù (when used during a match) are single-use copies

                  It works the way you would expect it to. The card copy would
                  have the current strength of the opponent‚Äôs Counselor Ahmi‚Äôs

                  would work just fine (although it would come back in hand
                  costing 2 mana, not 3). But if it‚Äôs played in a way that the
                  card would not come back in the hand, then the card copy is
                  destroyed.

                  The card copy of <CardLink id='N48' /> would not be able to

                  The card copy would cost 0 mana as well. There is no such
