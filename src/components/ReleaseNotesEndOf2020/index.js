            You will be rewarded <Coins amount={300} /> and{' '}
            <Rubies amount={30} /> upon login this week. While I have your
            attention, please wear a mask and avoid unnecessary
            travels‚Äîespecially if you live in an area with rampant COVID-19
            cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort to slow down this pandemic. Do the
            right thing. üôè

        <Title id='balance-changes'>Balance changes</Title>
        <p>
          This release, like any other, brings some balance changes for the new
          season starting on January 1st, including a new mechanic‚Äî
          <span className={css({ color: '#24e071' })}>vitality</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Vitality is essentially a reverse poison: not only does it heal
          poison, but it also buffs units by 1 strength at the beginning of
          every turn. Similarly, poison cancels vitality. Both of them are not
          subject to cancelation via freeze.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='S10' /> now costs 4 mana (up from 3) and will randomly
            dispatch the leftover damage amongst all surrounding units and
            structures (bases excluded).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='S19' /> now vitalizes the friendly units he flies
            over.
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N15' /> now vitalizes the target and buffs for
            2/3/4/5/6 (down from 3/4/5/6/7).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='F19' /> no longer need to be bordering a dragon to
            activate their ability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='W28' /> costs 5 mana (up from 4) and no longer need
            the enemy units in front to be weaker.
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='I8' />
            ‚Äôs base strength is now 2/2/3/3/3 (up from 1/1/2/2/3), and their
            ability grants 1/2/2/3/4 (down from 2/3/3/4/5).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Info icon='heart' title='Nerf compensation'>
          <p>
            Owners of Linked Golems will be compensated proportionally to the
            level of the card: <Coins amount='0/15/40/120/250' /> and{' '}
