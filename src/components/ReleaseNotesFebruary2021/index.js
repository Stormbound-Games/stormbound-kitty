          Hello Stormbounders! A new version of Stormbound is coming early
          February, bringing balance changes (and a well-deserved confusion
          buff), custom avatars, a cheap Brawl and some exclusive offers as
          usual!

          A brand new feature is coming with this release:{' '}
          <span className='Highlight'>player profiles</span>. Every player will
          be able to select a portrait amongst a predefined collection as well
          as a preferred faction, both of which will show up in the friends
          list.

        <p>
          As a result, the Fortress Level screen is being rebranded ‚ÄúPlayer
          Profile‚Äù, suggesting there will be more content to come, eventually
          fleshing out advanced player profiles!
