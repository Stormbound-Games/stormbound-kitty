          Back in April, Paladin Studios announced they would hand over
          Stormbound to a Polish game development studio called{' '}

          later, Sheepyard is ready to <Strikethrough>sheep</Strikethrough> ship

          Following Paladin Studios’ advice, the update will hit the production
          servers some time around July 21st, earliest. From there, the new
          version of the application will be gradually rolled out to app stores
          and players are encouraged to update the game as soon as possible. A
          few days later, a forced update will be conducted to migrate the
          remaining players to the latest version of the app. Only after that
          will the{' '}

          available.

            Anyone logging into the game at least once during the 3 days

            token of gratitude and to help with the fact that game development

        <Title id='economy-update'>Economy update</Title>

        <p>
          One thing Sheepyard has been quite adamant to tackle is the somewhat
          awkward in-game economy, particularly the disparity between resources.
          Their first attempt at taming the beast has been to revisit quests to
          restore some balance between the three currencies.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Tier 1 quests will now grant <Coins amount={100} />.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tier 2 quests will now grant <Rubies amount={5} />.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tier 3 quests will now grant <Coins amount={150} /> or{' '}
            <Stones amount={2} />, depending on the quest.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each quest can still be rerolled once per day, but a tier 1 quest will
          always grant coins, a tier 2 quest will always grant rubies and a tier
          3 quest will either grant coins (6 out of 10 quests) or fusion stones
          (4 out of 10 quests).

        <p>
          Sheepyard took a close look at the current state of the meta and went
          nuclear on its main assets, putting down the nerf hammer on many
          cards, especially but not limited to elders. This is only a first
          balance patch aiming at fixing the meta. It will be followed by over
          30 card updates in the next release to balance things further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the idea appears to be to progressively decouple the meta
          from aggressively cheap decks, and to favor control over rush. It will
          probably take a few releases and adjustments before getting there.

        <p>
          On top of making <CardLink id='N60' /> more accessible by decreasing
          their mana cost, Sheepyard has{' '}
          <Strikethrough>revisited</Strikethrough> fixed the confusion mechanic
          to make it more reliable.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className='Highlight'>New mechanic</span>: If confused, a unit
          has ⅓ chance to move forward, ⅓ chance to move inwards and ⅓ chance to
          move outwards. If sitting on the edge of the board, the unit has ⅓
          chance to move forward and ⅔ chance to move inwards.
        </p>

        <Info icon='sword' title='Existing implementation'>
          <p>
            While it might sound like it is how confusion currently works, it
            turns out that it’s not at all how it worked until now despite
            popular belief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, a confused unit has {'4\u20449'} chance (you read
            correctly) to go forward, ⅓ (or {'3\u20449'}) chance to go outwards
            and {'2\u20449'} chance to go inwards. When on the edge of the
            board, it has ⅔ chance to go forward and ⅓ chance to go inwards. No
            wonder we all thought it was broken.
          </p>
        </Info>

        <p>
          In the following situation, Westwind Sailors will now have a proper ⅓
          chance to go in any direction (but backwards). Similarly, Green
          Prototypes now have ⅓ chance to move forward, and ⅔ chance to move to
          the right side. That’s because they are sitting on the edge of the
          board, so the ⅓ chance to move to the left are effectively
          redistributed to the right side.

          Sheepyard also allowed me to announce that the next update will
          introduce two extra ways to induce confusion. They are planning on
          making confusion a mechanic to prolong games, essentially shifting the
          meta away from aggressively cheap decks. Note that the goal is not to
          make confusion the new freeze. It is only to provide a way to tempo
          games a little more.
        </p>

        <Title>Matchmaking tweaks</Title>

        <p>
          Stormbound has a long history of awkward matchmaking. In order to make
          it a little more fair, Sheepyard is introducing a base health upper
          limit based on the current league a player is in. The caps go as
          follow:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span className={css({ color: 'var(--diamond)' })}>Diamond</span>:
            no cap (besides 20 maximum health).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={css({ color: 'var(--platinum)' })}>Platinum</span>:
            health capped at 17.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={css({ color: 'var(--gold)' })}>Gold</span>: health
            capped at 14.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={css({ color: 'var(--silver)' })}>Silver</span>:
            health capped at 12.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={css({ color: 'var(--bronze)' })}>Bronze</span>:
            health capped at 11.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={css({ color: 'var(--iron)' })}>Iron</span>: health
            capped at 10.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Note that these upper limits on base health are not applied in Brawl
          mode whatsoever. Additionally, the CPU health has also been similarly
          adjusted when facing bots.

              Here, the base health—which is now named “

              Another minor interface change which can be seen behind the

              question: 'When is the update going to be released?',
              answer:
                'The update itself has been completed and sent to the different app stores for approval at the end of June. However because Stormbound has been silent for so long, it currently is deprioritised and quite far down the queue. We are hoping to see it on July 21st, but cannot make any guarantee. This is completely outside of Paladin or Sheepyard’s control and we cannot speed that up.',

              question: 'Is the confusion mechanic really better now?',
              answer:
                'Sheepyard has conducted a lot of tests after having patched it and it does feel incredibly more reliable than before. It remains a somewhat random mechanic of course, but it is way better this way. With the upcoming new confusion-inducing cards, it’s likely it will bring this mechanic in the meta.',

              question: 'What’s with all the nerfs and unsollicited buffs?',
              answer:
                'Most of the changes were a long time coming and carefully considered. The current meta relies too heavily on specific cards which makes for repetitive deck building. The goal is to eventually balance cards out so we see more variety in decks at all levels.',
            },

              question:
                'Does the base health cap means I cannot drop down a league if my health is higher than this league’s cap?',
              answer:
                'No. The league influences the maximum health of the base, and not the other way around. This change has no incidence whatsoever on the league itself.',
            },

        <p>
          That’s it for this update, which is not trivial for the first one from
          Sheepyard. They already have the next update in the starting blocks,
          including but not limited to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            As mentioned before, at least two new cards inducing confusion, thus
            helping making confusion-decks more competitive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Over 30 card tweaks across all factions, hopefully restoring some
            balance and improving some cards that have long been forgotten.
          </li>
          <li>
            A community tab within the game, with links to social media and
            Stormbound platforms.
          </li>
          <li>More options when it comes to friendly matches.</li>
        </ul>
