          <p>
            While I have your attention, please remember the pandemic is not
            over, even if you have been vaccinated. You can still carry the
            disease and make people sick.
          </p>
          <p>
            So wear a mask and avoid unnecessary travels‚Äîespecially if you live
            in an area with rampant COVID-19 cases. It takes everyone‚Äôs effort
            to slow down this pandemic. Do the right thing. üôè

        <p>This release, like any other, brings some balance changes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='I5' /> now inflicts 3 self-damage per turn (up from
            2).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='F13' />
            ‚Äôs strength is now 4/5/5/7/8 (up from 3/4/4/6/7).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N55' />
            ‚Äôs mana cost is now 7 (down from 8).
          </li>
          <li>
            <CardLink id='N73' />
            ‚Äôs strength is now 3/4/5/6/7 (up from 3/4/4/5/6).

          <li>
            <CardLink id='S3' />
            ‚Äôs ability is updated as follow:{' '}
            <span className='Highlight'>
              If played with no surrounding enemies, return the copy of this
              card to your hand with +1 strength
            </span>
            . The copy gains 1 strength every time it comes back in hand. If it
            does not, the additional strength is lost and the next draw will
            have the original strength. The base strength is now 1/2/3/4/5 (down
            from 2/3/4/5/6) and the ability is made surrounding.
          </li>

          <p>
            In case you missed it, the page of every card now lists the changes
            the card went through over the years and provides a handy way to
            visualize former versions of the card, before balance patches
            happened.{' '}

          Two new cards are joining the neutral faction! First, we have a new
          ancient card with impressive speed.

        <p>
          Then, we have rare construct which introduces ‚Äúfixed movement‚Äù.
          Essentially, this means it will not honor the usual attack resolution
          pattern (forwards, inwards, outwards) and will always move straight
          ahead.
        </p>

        <p>
          While it is somewhat similar to self-commanding as of today, it will
          be expanded in the near future into a more unique mechanic.

          Victory coins will be increased across the board in ranked matches,

        <p>Additionally, it is worth noting that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Victories while playing on Steam will yield the base amount per
            league only since ads cannot be watched on this platform‚Äîunless
            there is an active Premium Pass, in which case it‚Äôs doubled, just
            like when watching an ad.
          </li>

          <li>
            Victories while playing Brawl will yield <Coins amount={10} /> + an
            additional <Coins amount={10} /> for watching an ad or for having
            the Premium Pass, regardless of the league of the player.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To balance out the significant increase in victory coins in higher
          leagues, the monthly chest rewards have been reduced as follow (from
          1st of July onwards):
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The <span className={css({ color: 'var(--heroes)' })}>Heroes</span>{' '}

            chest now contains <Coins amount={1500} /> (down from 1,800). Rubies
            untouched.
          </li>
          <li>The chest for all the other leagues remain untouched.</li>
