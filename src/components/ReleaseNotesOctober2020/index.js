        <p>
          As <Link to='/releases/07-2020'>announced back in July</Link>, this
          update introduces two new cards aiming at buffing the confusion
          mechanic: <CardLink id='N78' /> (available as soon as October 1st) and{' '}
          <CardLink id='N79' /> (which will only be available from October 15th
          onwards).

          It has been announced and snapshot a few times on Discord over the
          last few weeks so it’s no longer a surprise for many of you: advanced
          friendly matches are coming!
        </p>
        <p>
          When starting a friendly match with an in-game friend, it is now
          possible to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>cap the level of cards (from 1 to 5)</li>
          <li>cap the fortress level (1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 20)</li>
          <li>pick the starting mana (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24)</li>
          <li>
            set up a turn counter (10, 20 or 30; with possibility of ties as
            shown in the video below)
          </li>
          <li>apply Brawl modifiers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Not all these settings are available to all players. They get unlocked

              The “social panel” has been hyped a few times on Discord over the
              last few weeks, and is a good testament of Sheepyard’s intents to
              grow the game and its community.

              It features Discord, Reddit, Stormbound-Kitty (needless to say I’m
              deeply honored to be featured in the game), the Stormbound Wiki
              (by FrozenEarth) and social networks (Facebook, Twitter and

              total. Not bad for just a few taps!

              Additionally, there will be many more UI improvements aiming at
