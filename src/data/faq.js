        answer: (

            <p>
              Chrome has an accessibility setting that prevents text from being
              too small. Because cards need to look ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù at any size,
              they use a tiny font size, which might not match that safeguard
              from Chrome.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can deactivate that feature in Chrome‚Äôs Settings > Appearance
              > Customise Fonts > Minimum font size. Set it to ‚Äútiny‚Äù, and
              everything should look good!

        answer: (
          <>
            These tools run inside your browser, there is no database behind
            them. When you share something like a sim or card, the data is
            encoded in the URL. For cards, it‚Äôs big because of the free-text
            nature of the name, the ability and the URL. If we were to allow
            custom cards in the battle sim, the encoded data would have to
            contain all the custom cards as well. That‚Äôs unpractical.

            Drag and drop is not an easy thing to implement on the web, and
            unfortunately it gets even trickier on mobile due to the presence of
            scroll and swipe gestures.

            <p>
              Technically, all cards can be played regardless of faction thanks

              Moveover, the battle sim is used a lot for creating puzzles, which
              can be made more or less difficult and/or interesting by making it
              possible to have cards from multiple factions.

            The deck suggestions are determined based on heuristics and educated
            guesses. They do not result from a thorough analysis of the decks,
            and they definitely are not based on real game data. They are only
            generic suggestions from experimented players.

            The point of these tools is not exclusively to reproduce the game

            The random deck generator is not 100% random, in the sense that it
            doesn‚Äôt just pick 12 cards at random. It makes sure the deck doesn‚Äôt
            contain too many spells or too many structures, that the mana curve
            is not too steep, and that combos can still work (freeze, poison‚Ä¶).

        answer: (
          <>
            <p>
              Stormbound uses a ‚Äúweighted random‚Äù. That means each card in a
              deck is assigned a certain weight which determines its chances of
              being drawn.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the beginning of the game, an initial routine assigns a weight
              to all cards in the deck in a (truly this time) random way. From
              there, 4 cards are drawn with the usual weighted random to compose
              the initial hand.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every time a card is drawn or cycled, its weight is reset to 0.
              All the other cards in the deck see their weight increase to f(w)
              = 1.6 * w + 1 (rounded), where w is their previous weight. Some
              cards, such as Queen of Herds, have awkward mechanics.

            It is an arbitrary number to measure the value of a{' '}
            <Link to='/collection'>card collection</Link>. It is based on the
            rarity and the amount of copies you have of each card. It also take
            into account the initial crafting cost of all cards, which is why an
            entire collection of cards level 1 with no extra copies is worth
            about 3000 stones.

        question: 'How does the book calculator work?',
        answer: (
          <>
            <p>
              The book calculator calculates the probability of not getting
              Fusion Stones (FS) out of a book (other calculations are just
              small variations of this one). To do that, it lays down all the
              different ‚Äúdrawing sequences‚Äù: For example, ‚ÄòEEELEL‚Äô (Epic, Epic,
              Epic, Legendary, Epic, Legendary) is a valid and likely sequence
              for a Mythic book. So at the core, it is a function that takes a
              drawing sequence and returns the probability of getting this
              sequence and no fusion stones out of a book.
            </p>
            <p>
              To do this, the calculator stores the non-FS cards left in the
              pool it draws from (Epic and Legendary for a Mythic book) and
              iterates over the sequence cards. With the ‚ÄòEEELEL‚Äô sequence: The
              first card is an Epic card, with a probability of 0.7 (70%), the
              probability of it not being the FS epic card is 41/42. It
              substracts 1 from the Epic cards count and goes to the next card.
              The second card is an Epic one too, with a probability of 0.7 *
              40/41 since identical cards cannot be redrawn. It then iterates
              over the whole sequence, returns the resulting probability and
              sums over the different sequences to get the total probability of
              not getting fusion stones out of a Mythic book.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course this is correct only under the assumption that book
              draws work this way.

              There are a couple of reasons why your image could not be loaded.
              One of them is that the website you link it from doesn‚Äôt allow it,

              The other possibility is that what you‚Äôre linking is not an image

              the image, then click on something like ‚ÄúCopy image address‚Äù to
