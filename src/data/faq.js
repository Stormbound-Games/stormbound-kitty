              <Link to='/releases'>release notes</Link> for the game. It is a
              mutually beneficial partnership: Sheepyard gets to use this
              relatively well-known site for official announcements, and I get
              paid for the work I do on official communication.

              That being said, Sheepyard only pays for the work I do on release

            <p>
              Chrome has an accessibility setting that prevents text from being
              too small. Because cards need to look ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù at any size,
              they use a tiny font size, which might not match that safeguard
              from Chrome.

              current state in a rather digestible format. Values varying across
              levels such as strength are authored as strings and might have to
              be unpacked manually (e.g. <code>"1/2/3/4/5"</code>).

        answer: (
          <>
            These tools run inside your browser, there is no database behind
            them. When you share something like a sim or card, the data is
            encoded in the URL. For cards, it‚Äôs big because of the free-text
            nature of the name, the ability and the image URL (if any). If we
            were to allow custom cards in the battle sim, the encoded data for a
            sim would have to contain all the custom cards‚Äô data as well. That‚Äôs
            unpractical.

            Drag and drop is not an easy thing to implement on the web, and

            scroll and swipe gestures.

              Technically, all cards can be played regardless of faction thanks

              Moveover, the battle sim is used a lot for creating puzzles, which

              possible to have cards from multiple factions.

            The deck advice are determined based on heuristics and educated
            guesses. They do not result from a thorough analysis of the decks,

            The point of these tools is not exclusively to reproduce the game

            The random deck generator is not 100% random, in the sense that it
            doesn‚Äôt just pick 12 cards at random. It makes sure the deck doesn‚Äôt
            contain too many spells or too many structures, that the mana curve
            is not too steep, and that combos can still work (freeze, poison‚Ä¶).

              Legendary) is a valid and likely sequence for a Mythic Tome. So at

              stones out of a book.

              To do this, the calculator stores the non-FS cards left in the
              pool it draws from (Epic and Legendary for a Mythic Tome) and
              iterates over the sequence cards. With the ‚ÄòEEELEL‚Äô sequence: The
              first card is an Epic card, with a probability of 0.7 (70%), the
              probability of it not being the FS epic card is 41/42. It
              substracts 1 from the Epic cards count and goes to the next card.
              The second card is an Epic one too, with a probability of 0.7 *
              40/41 since identical cards cannot be redrawn. It then iterates
              over the whole sequence, returns the resulting probability and
              sums over the different sequences to get the total probability of
              not getting fusion stones out of a Mythic Tome.

              Of course this is correct only under the assumption that book
              draws work this way.

        question: 'How does the value calculator work?',
        answer: (

            <p>
              The <Link to='/calculators/value'>value calculator</Link>, despite
              efforts from <Link to='/member/Derk'>Derk</Link> (Derk#7109), is
              not an accurate representation of cards‚Äô value. First of all, they
              are evaluated in isolation instead of as part of a deck.
              Additionally, their value is based on a single turn so structures
              and elders are undervalued. Finally, a lot of cards cannot be
              statically valued without more information about the state of the
              game.
            </p>
            <p>
              The basic formula for estimating the value of a card is to take
              its strength or damage divided by its mana cost time its speed
              factor, as illustrated below. The speed factor is either 0.5, 1,
              1.5, 1.75 or 2 depending on the effective movement of a card
              between 0 and 4.

              For sake of simplicity and/or realism, some liberties have been
              taken which are relevant when understanding the value output:

                Spells are played in a sensical way to ensure a meaningful
                minimum value.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hand manipulations, freeze, poison, confusion, command, disable
                and vitality are ignored.

                Mana is capped to 30 (e.g. Lady Rime and Visions of the Grove).
              </li>
              <li>Tiles are capped to 10 (instead of 20, for realism).</li>
              <li>
                Strength is capped to the maximum vanilla strength (e.g.
                Confinement and Siren of the Seas).

            <p>
              There are a couple of reasons why your image could not be loaded.
              One of them is that the website you link it from doesn‚Äôt allow it,
              in which case it could be reuploaded somewhere else, or replaced
              with another image.
            </p>

            <p>
              The other possibility is that what you‚Äôre linking is not an image
              but a web page containing an image. Make sure to right click on
              the image, then click on something like ‚ÄúCopy image address‚Äù to
              get the actual URL.
