    title: 'Green Prototypes',
    content: `It was as if you could still hear the buzzing of the chains and the clicking of the gears. The Green Prototypes are an expendable but irreplaceable part of a good army.
    The Rodents were planning something. The entire land knew it. The farming had been a problem for eons; The satyrs had been doing it, but they were slow and lazy. The creatures knew they needed a more efficient solution, and a cheap one as well. The rodents worked ceaselessly to produce the balanced equation; The Green Prototypes.
    They were never meant for battle. They were cost-effective and fast. If they were destroyed, they healed their attacker so no damage might come to them. Who knows? They might have been deactivating a faulty prototype. They were an amazing solution.
    When the storm raged on, the prototypes survived the storms and thunders. They harnessed the energy and survived off the lightning. When the species emerged, they were surprised to see them still standing. The Chosen Ones repurposed them in battle. Using them for scouting and strategy was a good idea. Although they didn’t do any real damage when fighting a bigger opponent, the Chosen Ones realized if they were destroyed when no opposition was near, the medical supplies in the bots just wasted away.
    Thus, they were used for more than your average farming tools. By repurposing them for a greater cause, they quickly became a driving force in the war for Mana Crystals. They are a stronghold of power, begging to be used.`,

    content: `The Gifted Recruits of the Knights of Valour were not always as strong as he is now. Back when the Storm never arrived, He was a timid and shy little creature. He got picked on in class and were never favoured by the teachers. He had such little strength to fight back. All he had between them and total decimation was his helmet and his sword. In this sense, he was weak. His mana cost was extremely low. People never gave him a second thought.
    Yet he believed. They knew he could be part of something more. He knew he could blow away the crowd. So he worked hard and fought bravely. One day, past curfew, he snuck out at night to this little place by the riverside and practiced his swords training.
    When he found others like him.
    These people were as timid and as shy as him. He grew to like them, and they worked as a team. They fought off every obstacle along their journey. He came back knowing he was part of something special.
    The school was attacked by rouge frostlings. They were casting damaging and punishing spells upon the school. Bravely, the new and improved and certainly very gifted recruits advanced, sidestepped and parried all the frostlings attacks and saved the school from decimation. They knew they had power in numbers.
    When the storm came, these little guys had nobody to turn to but themselves. He and his recruits hid out together with the rest of the independent neutrals. They now hone their abilities and prowess to the skilled art of battle. They truly are a huge asset to the team.`,

    content: `Although these creatures are known as one of the most powerful and investment worthy, they are still shy inside.
    The Lawless Herd was never brave. That was an overstatement. If you dropped a stone in their pack, they would run amok. But one day, they learned to drop their fears and stand up for what was right.
    The Herd resided in the Silver Swamps just to the right of the main lands. Most people thought they were unwise for doing so; That is what they wanted. Peace and quiet.
    When they spotted the storm, they knew they were in for danger. Their leader knew that it wouldn’t hit them if they stayed in place. Everyone opted for this decision.
    But one little satyr said no. He was tired of being timid and shy. He wanted to be part of something more. Something important. He alone marched up to the mainland to try and warn the others.
    If there is anything the Lawless Herd is good at, it is being loyal. They all followed the young one and swarmed the mainland. It was only with their help that any people at all survived the storms.
    At the end of the alert, as they all huddled back in the caverns, waiting for the storms to strike, they knew they had gained something much more valuable than the other peoples trust and admiration. They had gathered bravery. And that was all they needed. The Herd decided to turn a new leaf and fight for their kingdoms. To fight for their rights.
    While being a weak creature, they were easy to summon. A single mana crystal was all that needed to be used for the initiation of the Herd. They became known as one of the most easy creatures to summon, fighting for its place in the eye of the storm.`,

    content: `The swift and agile Mutineers strike an agile and swift punch. They fight for what is right. Having their minor downsides is what makes them who they are.
    The Mutineers were made of a normal pirate crew. They were sailing along the Radiant Straights when they realized they could do more.
    They were always the best in the crew. Certainly better than the captain: All he did was sit around, drink and yell. They fought better, shot better and drove better. They were more strategic, powerful and simply were better.
    And yet they only came second to first. Blocked by that useless captain. Things needed to change. Quickly. And so the plans were placed down.
    It all happened in the night. The captain was thrown overboard and the crew was gathered sword point to the holding areas. Anyone who didn’t conform to the new change of staff wasn’t able to stay long enough to fight for it. The Mutineers became the captains.
    As the storm struck, the ship floated in the air. Luckily, the crew was all in the holding areas, and nobody got hurt. Sensing an opportunity, the Mutineers trained the crew to be better at battle. They themselves became swifter, more agile and more effective.
    They used three mana crystals to form their pure power. Their speciality was driving straight into a baseline. They were always powerful. However, they came with a drawback.
    As the captain fell overboard, he cursed the talented sailors for their life. For being selfish. For only looking out for themselves. He cursed them to lose their companions. To lose their only friends.
    At first, the Mutineers didn’t think much of it. Every time they attacked, a comrade went missing. Fine. They didn’t need them anyway. But as the Crystals started coming in faster, they realized the difference comrades make together.
    Mutineers is a creature that works beautifully in cohesion with other creatures, especially high cost and ineffective creatures. Their power makes up for all loss. However, the curse of the captain will always and forever be upon them.`,

    They were pretty simple creatures, costing only four mana crystals to summon. But their skills were not appreciated as well as they should have been.
    They were very rude, snobby and quite ill-mannered. They were impatient and were an unpopular figure in the community. They were paid very well for their services, and nobody could deny they were good at their job. However, they were very rich and never gave a single shard to help the needy.
    One day, the Snowmasons did something unforgiveable. They completely disrespected an elderly knight, retired from his valiant and brave conquests. He was left feeling down and depressed.
    The creatures had had enough. They went up to the Town Hall and demanded that the Snowmasons be punished for their disrespect. The grand elder fined them all of their money.
    They felt devastated. Their life savings were all gone: Funding the useless efforts of the townspeople in farming. Who needed farming? Just buy your food.
    As the Snowmasons pondered, they realized there would be no food without farming. They realized they were missing out on the bigger picture, and that they needed others to sustain themselves.
    They decided to turn over a new leaf and start afresh. They turned their attention into helping others and making weapons for defence, and for free.
    They quickly amassed much more money than before, mostly because of their new kindness and empathy. They left lots of their main wealth – Mana Crystals – in their will for their best friends.
    When the storm came, they sacrificed themselves so their mana crystals could be converted into strength. They bravely allowed many others to survive as the lightning fell on the ground. They are a force to be appreciated, and a team creature on the field of battle.`,

    Ubass was a normal guy. He hunted in the Forgotten Forests with his pack of tamed wolves. He shot down only predatory animals, to save the harmless ones, like rabbits. His favourite shots were tigers.
    He drew power from the diversity of the animals and creatures around him. It was as if their very existence gave him essence. They cleared his mind and gave him strength. With every friendly creature, he knew he had the support he needed to make the axes count.
    Ubass was blind. He had a hyena skin to make him look more natural, for the red eyes to strike fear into his prey. His sense of hearing was excellent. When multiple things moved around him, when heat was generated, he felt it. His axe throwing was unparalleled. Nobody could compete, and he earned the title of Hunter.
    When the storm came, he bravely guided the creatures near him toward the caverns of the neutrals. His axes formed a trail for anyone left behind to follow. His hearing allowed him to avoid thunder before it could strike. He was an ideal leader. A pathfinder in the stormy abyss.
    When the blindness and dark came, he was the creatures light. He saw everything just fine. The darkness never affected him. And when the storm finally receded, the Chosen Ones appreciated his talent. They began to repurpose his abilities.
    He strikes quick, fast and damaging. His only downside is he doesn’t really know what he is hitting. He goes forward and destroys. His friends support him during hard times.
    Ubass is a Hero whos power is so immense, many Chosen Ones resent him. They run when they see him on the battlefield. Others decide to use his power for good. He leads the way even when the times are tough. His strength is beyond comprehension.`,

However, they were stranded in the Swamps of Shadowfen, and thus needed a good force to make sure they were never alone. For people alone in the swamps were never alone for long.
    So they created the Korodachi Strings, made of spider silk and mahogany. The little wooden boards, the fine little puppet threads… It looked perfect. Now all it needed was a puppet to control.
    People were easy enough to find. Lost wanderers were always there. It just took a swish of the Strings and they were completely under the Ministers control. It didn’t take long for them to master their ability and amass a huge force. Entire platoons were taken by surprise.
    However, they got cocky and tried to convert a massive force, at least twice as many Ministers were there. They soon found out that 12 knights can indeed slay 5 Ministers before getting converted. They realized that they could only take as many people as there were Ministers.
    Soon, word of the Korodachi Strings reached the ears of the High Priestess, Klaxi, who demanded the Ministers be brought before her. The Ministers were able to convert all the guards who brought them to Klaxi, and made a deal with her. They would join the Tribes of Shadowfen for infinite string and wood.
    And so it was done. The Ministers would provide an excellent force for Shadowfen for days to come. And the Ministers would be able to collect whatever they wanted now…`,

    content: `So… what’s under the islands, I bet you’re asking?
    Well, let’s go to the beginning. When the Pangeic Kingdom was still around.
    There were 5 sectors: The Swarm, where great antlered humanoids roamed. The Union, built up by rodents, bringing servers to the other sectors. The Tribes, a small avian area with an underlying toad slave trade. The Pact, the icy spirits and the stonehearted humanoids that could withstand their great frost. And finally, the Melee. The center of the four factions, the Melee kept all of the other four factions at peace.
    But of course, storms always strike at the bonds, don’t they? Shattered, the earth below their very feet crumbled as the Melee broke apart. Not any one of the sides knew what caused it, apart from the great suspicion of the others. Could it have been the ancient necrotic worshippers? The filthy copperblood polluters? The sadistic bird imposters? Or even the prideful heat thieves? The Melee was demolished, removing any sort of peace. Great airborne islands were thrown up into the air… and others were thrown down below. Now now, we’re here. Well, when you remove something from a location, what is left? That’s correct, nothing is. The Void was formed, a yawning pit below everyone’s feet. Countless bodies were thrown down into it as the storm lifted, and all perished… except for one race. You see, the Void is peculiar. Solid matter cannot exist there, more so gases, or possibly liquids. Now, tell me, son, how many races are solid? Yes, that’s correct, all of them, apart from them. The Frostlings. Now, just because it could exist doesn’t mean it wasn’t changed. You see, the Frostlings were melded. Shaped. Changed. They forgot their past down there. They forgot about the cold and were reborn into nothingness. And now, you see, they’ve been finding their way up here, surging into our world from that Void. Invaders, they are. So now you know. Anything else you’d like to know?

All memories tucked away like the thousands of winter sagas that line the shelves of the this vast archive. Yet out of all these memories, both fond and feared, there is one that refuses to join its brothers and sisters in the past…
    It was in Autumn’s equinox the day the renegades attacked, only a mere decades after the Pact's signing. A younger me, only several hundred years old, fled to the safety of the Archive walls. Alas, the walls could only hold for so long as a ball of hellfire fell from the sky and destroyed our last line of defense. As the wall fell, my fellow refugees fled deeper into the Archive, while I stood in place, frozen with fear.
    Due to my frequent visits of the library, I've learned many things about the land that lay beyond the Tempest, most intriguing being the ferocious Dragons that lived in the corners of this world. Yet, what emerged from the hole was not a Dragon, but another frostling. At first, I was relieved, but his reddish complexion cut my moment of peace short. As Frostlings, the path to the Grove lay in stillness. "Calm amidst a raging storm" were the words our mentors taught us, yet, I never really pondered what would happen if we were to defy them. At that moment, I finally knew.
    I looked into the eyes of my fellow frostling. His eyes were cold, but a raging inferno burned behind them. Instead of the familiar chill of a frostling's presence, an unsettling void filled the air. Before long, a group of Hexers emerged from the Archives behind me, restoring the air to its natural crispness. Simultaneously, a company of local knights has gathered in the street outside. This was an ambush.
    The Hexers slowly advanced, subduing the frostling with beams of frigid mana. As the defector struggled, the knights closed in, swords raised to deliver the killing blow.
    It never came.
    As his enemies drew near, the frostling roared with unbridled fury as a bolt of lightning struck down from the sky and annihilated all that stood before him in a flash of primal light.
    I awoke minutes later, the scent of smoke filled the air as what was left of the building around me smoldered. Dazed, I saw the rogue frostling in the distance. Untouched. Unharmed. He turned to look at me. Nothing stirred behind those frozen eyes.

In my travels, I witnessed both the beauty and peril of this broken world, and felt the forbidden binds of emotion that drive a mortal’s ambitions. Alas, my actions were not without consequence. The majority of fellow frostlings now regard me like slush in a dirty puddle. Even those in my inner circle no longer respond to my letters… Oh, how I miss the crisp embrace of Winter. Alas, I cannot return to snow just yet, as there is more to our world than snow and ice.

Yes, the smog clouds were calm, slow… but something was different… something dark was coming, looming over the clouds of smoke and steam that escaped the living city. The bronze pipes, shining with use and mist droplets reflected the shadow that slowly came near. It was huge, as big as a MC-314 gear (the ones from the upgrade stations) and it was about to emerge.  The little mouse gulped and froze with fear.
    A mighty dragon came roaring down, its cry shaking the buildings, and as the beast soared, terrible flames spew out of his large mouth, blowing away anything in its path. He  flew and flew around the city with his bellowing flames and then sat on the old clocktower, and as it creaked under his might weight, the rodents gave away into panic, crying and shambling to find a weapon, an explosive of some kind, or just shelter. The dragon roared again with a hint of pain in his voice as the mice started to lauch their makeshift explosives at him. Then, a scream came from the speakers scattered aorund the city: "STOP!!" it was her voice, Mia. There she was, on her (almost) indistructible giant, coming down from her tower. She squinted at the titan. "Bring me the prototype." she commanded, smirking "let's see if it works on bigger vermin". From her tower she had seen the dragon and she knew what he had done: with his terrible distruction he drew the royal M on her city, melting the rooftops and crushing the workshops. He had called her, he wasn't there to destroy, he was there to talk. Losing a couple of factories was worth such a powerful ally.
    Shaking, the ingeneer put the last metal plate gently on the dragon's scaled skin. The machine turned on, buzzed, and a faint light emitted from the screen. "My Brillancy, it works! The giant can communicate with us now trough his thoughts!" "Perfect. So, why have you called me?" The screen turned red, and as the might dragon closed his eyes focusing, his thoughts cleared: flames, clouds, magic, dragons. Newborn from the storm, the dragons scattered across the lands, feasting and looking for a land to call home. Many just looked for survival, but others were smarter, and knew they will need allies to thrive. North, East, South, the mightiest dragons went to form pacts and alliances with the Queens and Priestesses that rules over the land. Now it was time for this might dragon to find his ally, and ally that would make him better, and ally that would understand his power. An ally like Mia and the Ironclad Union.`,

    content: `Today was a peaceful day for everyone. There was no fighting at all, except at the Dusty Plains.
    A mighty black dragon with cracks on his skin revealing lava flowing under were fighting against the troops of the Union, because the dragon thought it was a good idea to snack on a rodent.
    The dragon was winning, but not without a cost. His wings were damaged and he couldn’t hold on for much longer.
    He managed to defeat the latest wave of rodents, but the next wave made him somewhat nervous, as the queen of the Union herself came to fight with her greatest creation, PH03-nix.
    But surprisingly, he din’t get punched in the face by the giant robot. Instead, the queen signaled for the fighting to stop.
    “I have a deal for you, mighty Eloth” declared the queen.
    “Oh? And what is this deal that you think would make me reconsider destroying all of you right now?” questioned Eloth.
    “Your body is quite damaged is it not? If the fighting goes on, you’ll soon lose the ability to fly—amongst other things. But we can repair you,even make you better than you once were. I’ll see to it personally.” The queen proclaimed boldly.
    “What’s the catch?”
    “You fight for us against anyone we deem fit to be meet their demise against you.” The queen answered.
    It was certainly a deal. Having the greatest engineer known to the land upgrade him was certainly going to make him much more stronger. And he always wanted more power.
    Without hesitation, he left behind the remaining two siblings he had.
    “It’s a deal, your majesty.’ Eloth told her.
    "Please, call me Mia." Mia told him.`,

He is by far the wisest and smartest of the 5, and with his strategical mind, he can most certainly lead his hypothetical army to victory.
    But he never got what he wanted.
    On one sunny day, during his daily walk, he stumbled upon a fight between a camp set up north from the new kingdom, the Swarm, and wandering travellers from the Winter Pact. The Winter Pact was a topic he wanted to avoid, as it constantly reminded him of the day Zhevana left and never returned. He wanted to leave, but the urge to analyze the new kingdom was stronger than his own will.
    The camp of Swarm immediately outnumbered the travellers,as reinforcement seemingly came out of thing air. The travellers were quickly overwhelmed, as a camp far outnumbered the likes of travellers.
    This Swarm was interesting. To call out for reinforcements and have them immediately come to their aid was quite a sight, and their ability to move as a cohesive unit was simply breathtaking.
    This. This was the army he was looking for.
    That night, a great big dragon stormed the camps of the Swarm and when it proved victorious, asserted itself as the new Lord of the Swarm.`,

Now that the ones who had abandoned them were slain, they had nothing to do but search for a new, stronger leader. Their brutality helped them achieve this.

    She wasn’t cruel however. She wouldn’t kill an innocent child, but that din’t matter because who in their right mind would bring a child to fight against one of the 5 great dragons?
    She was proven wrong.
    She felt a child no more than 8 years old convert her mana into physical strength. She was almost worried as she’s never seen this ability before in anyone, but the child was too grief stricken to do anything with that strength.
    “Mama! Papa! Please wake up! The little girl cried in vain.
    — Your pleas are of no use, child. They are dead.” Zhevana told her.
    — But why? What did any of them do to deserve this?” The girl asked her.
    — They were planning to torture me until I would be obedient to them. What I did to them could be called a mercy compared to what they would’ve done to me.” Zhevana answered.
    — What do I do now? I have no home, no family, nothing.” She asked.
    Zhevana almost regretted killing the warriors. She felt sorry for the child, as she knew how much the lost of parents hurt. The girl was also a prodigy. She could take her in as one as her own or waste this potential.
    She decided.
    — Would you like to journey with me? Together, we can achieve many things,even rebuild the Winter Pact if you’d like.” Zhevana offered.

A hand, was extended to her, it was one of the goatmen dressed in red and gold robes holding a scepter in the other hand. He said “My queen, welcome back. Come your majesty, I have someone who would want to meet you.”
    She looked at his hands, then back at him. She accepted it and he helped her up.
    As she stood out of her sarcophagus, the undead bowed to her, and the goatmen behind them knelt down in unison. They all then said “All hail the queen!” She was still confused at what is actually going on, but she played along. Then the goatman in robes motioned her to a large stone door at the edge of the great room. She followed him as the undead and goatmen made way for her. When she made it to the end, a great stone door was infront of her, guarded by two undeads wielding a scythe. The goatman then said “Open the door” the two undead then bowed and said “By your command, my liege” then the great stone door raised to reveal a blinding world. She went ahead of the goatman to see a vast desert.
    She then saw a cliff nearby, and a great golden dragon was overlooking it. It then flew to her. The dragon then said in a majestic tone “Greetings, my queen. a new age has come. And you will help me restore the empire.” She was still awed but managed to regain her composure and said “And who are you, dragon?” The dragon bowed his head and said “Xuri, my queen. Lord of Life.” He then turned to the vast expanse of desert and said to her “Come, my queen. For we have much to do” it was silent for a moment, then the goatman in robes asked her what she should be called by her people. She thought for a moment then said “I shall be called… the queen of herds.”`,

Though over time, I’ve realized these scribblings were much more than what they appeared to be.

    Bitten by the cold between their hooves, the satyr stood no chance. The fur on their backs was not enough to shield them from the winter's cold, rather it was harvested by the dwarfs. How? How was it that the dwarfs had survived? They had nothing but the fur of the satyr keeping them warm, and yet even without proper covering, the dwarfs thrived. It was no use. The satyr marched across the winter tundra only for the few who survived the cold to be blocked be the many defensive structures of the dwarfs. They had no choice but to retreat.
    Upon returning, our mighty leader, the queen, and the dragon of life all discussed how to survive in the tundra. But only arguments arose. The queen insisted that the satyr move faster than the cold could, but previous encounters proved this tactic not enough as the cold magic would smite them in Mass. The dagons where durable beasts, capable of surviving the desert or the cold, but they could not help the satyr keep warm. Ahmi knew how they could survive, with proper placement, capable troops, and the selfless sacrifice of a few dosen units, the swarm would prevail. The satyr groaned at this brute force that Ahmi adored, they argued that they could not cover all defensive and offensive positions as he expected. All hope was lost that day for the swarm, until a select few spoke up.
    Those few where nicknamed the divisors. They where those few on the frontline who had survived. They had seen the architecture of the dwarfs and where up to the challenge of building structures to house the satyr. With the help of the shady ghoul, the divisors obtained the blueprints for an early prototype of upgrade point. It was meant to provide strength to a large quantity of rats, but the union was unable to make it function properly. The divisors knew why, it was far too industrial to work on living creatures, and they knew how to fix it. The divisors reworked the design to allow the satyr to stay spread far apart from each other, therefore encouraging their growth instead of hampering it.
    This development pleased the rest of the swarm, enough that the queen requested them for a personal project. The queen wanted a new structure and the divisors where threatened their lives if they failed. The divisors where confident in their designing abilities and worked with the queen to make it. However the divisors became fearful when they learned from the queen that the structure used dark magic to function, and they knew if they told the rest of the swarm that the queen would surely kill them. They could not hold such a dark secret. The moment they finished the blueprint, they ran from the swarm, swearing to never design any building ever again. In fact, they would now go out of their way to destroy any building they saw, if only to forget their horrible crime.

An irreversible mistake. The construct, in one swift motion, threw the Raven off balance, and knocked him to the ground with a fatal blow. There, it plunged its blade into the chest of the wounded Raven, who let out a faint squawk. It hewed the Raven, and drove the blade from the chest to the neck, slowly.

We were supposed to be sentries, defending the Pact in case a siege became underway. Almost frozen in time, our sparkrods always at the ready by our sides. None could step out of line.
    At least, not in view of another.
    I looked around, my metal mask clanking as my neck fought against the brass brace around it. I didn’t see any others around, or it was just too crowded. Quickly, I rushed up to her, trying to keep my cool.
    “H-hey.” Quite the start. But what else could I have said?
    She turned as she heard my voice. Not to brag, but I sound pretty robust.
    “Oh, hello. Do you need something, sir?”
    She couldn’t see it, but behind my mask, my emotions were in anarchy.
    Yes, I had a duty. And if it were to be found broken, the same would come upon me.
    But there’s so much curiousity about what’s behind that barrier.
    “A-actually, I was just wondering if you would like to… uh… hang out, or the such…” okay, maybe I didn’t sound robust at all times.
    I could see a slight smirk curl her lips as I uttered those words. “Say, what type of hang out?”
    Little did I know that she liked to play.
    “Uh, you know, just… hang out?” I started to shake. The only other time I’ve felt this was when I came face to face with Logger’s adaptive abilities.
    The smirk peaked more. “Alright, I’m interested. Where to, big guy?”
    “Er… maybe… the Ice Gardens? I heard the sculptures are much more beautiful around this time.”
    The Ice Gardens are the only place that we could go anyways, too unimportant to be defended with sentries.
    The smirk bloomed into a full smile by this point. “Sounds good. I’ll meet you there around… 8?”
    “Perfect. I’ll be there.”
    “Alright! Nice to meet you, sir.” A quick wink as she turned and went away.
    Holy hell, that wink. It brought something to me.

    Her.
    Sneaking past the rest of the guards, no more sparkrods, was slightly difficult. Yes, we don’t make sounds when moving, but do you see how large I am? Luckily, I did make it there. And it seemed like she did too.
    Because we don’t have electronic lights here, there’s no light pollution. And that’s right when I learned why I should be thankful for that.
    The moon’s light shone down directly on her, illuminating the various angles of her wear, turning the indigo into more of a purple. Her back turned to me, I was hoping I could see the source of the wink soon again. And sure enough, I did.
    She turned to me, eyes now glistening in the lunar glow. Now, without my mask on, she could definitely see my amazed stare. She giggled, only showing me how much more I wanted her. Not something chosen for me, something I chose myself.
    “Hey, nice to see you again.”
    I couldn’t respond. I was water in winter.

    She sighed and chuckled a little bit, coming up to me. She took my hand and guided me to a bench to sit down with her at, a cryostatue brilliantly glowing like clear gems in the moonlight.
    “So, how are you?”
    First thing she asked me. Like nothing else mattered.
    From what I can recall, no one else has ever said those words to me, cared about my wellbeing.
    How are you.
    I…
    …“I don’t know.”
    She looked… perplexed. “What do you mean?”
    “I just… I don’t know. I don’t know how I am. I’ve only felt one straight mindset for most of the time: numb. Stuck. Until I met you, like an infection… wait, what’s that look for?”
    She looked surprised, almost mad. “She told me that you were treated right, given emotions…”
    I didn’t understand. “Who?”
    “The Lady.”
    My eyes widened. No one could have connections to the Lady.
    Except…
    “You’re her daughter?!” I whispered harshly, almost a yell.
    She sighed once more. “Wish I wasn’t. She’s always so stagnant, keeping her people in control. I thought I at least brought change to all of you, but… it appears I haven’t.”
    I was still in a daze. What I wanted was my master’s kin?!
    “I… it can be changed.” I wanted to make her happy.
    Her head perked up. “It can? How?”
    “I’m not exactly sure, but… we need to give emotion ourselves to the others. Just like…”
    I paused. How are you supposed to say you want the sky you stand under?
    “Hell, I want you. Right when I saw you, felt your aura. I wanted you. Right when I saw that smirk, heard your voice, felt that damn wink, I wanted you. Right when I saw you walk away and return to my view by lunar wings, I wanted you. I have never known what I have wanted and now I’ve found you and I don’t want to let you go because I don’t want to lose again and I want you to be happy and get what you want but I know that I’m below you but I know that you’re right here and you’re listening to me rant about this about how I want you so bad-“
    My lips were suddenly sealed by hers.
    Frozen in time, just like at the post.
    But this time, instead of fearing the dropping bombs, I enjoyed them.
    We stayed like that, for quite some time.
    Until the fearful bombs accompanied the heavenly ones.
    I covered her with myself, absorbing the shock. She held my arm tight, my back getting pounded by a new want.
    A want to protect.
    Anger swelled up in me. I snarled as I swung around. Turns out no defense in the Ice Gardens was a fool’s idea.
    A sudden duty rose up as well. The Pact must be defended. Loud blares of sound all around us. She still clung to me.
    “Listen, I’m sorry about this. I have to go.”
    “No, please… stay with me. We can continue your idea, and I can help you, and…” her pleads were almost drowned out by the roar of war.
    “I have to. I’ll be back, alright?” I looked her directly in the eyes.
    She stared at me for a couple moments in consideration.
    “Are you sure about this?”
    I pulled away from her, mask dropping down onto my face, sparkrods forming in my hands.
    I responded, “Yes, I’m sure. I promise. I love you.”
    I never got a response.
    Instead, I got shattering.
    I got a stampede.
    I got a disappearance.
    I got angry.
    I joined the insane stampede, a legion of energy crashing towards a disgusting metal army.
    I fought with my new rage. The sparkrods firing out, smashing the tin cans, retaining damage, I did it all with rage.
    I did it all for her.
    My rage gave energy to my teamates. We destroy, we recycle, we reuse, we repeat.
    And we won.
    But I did not.
    I am still fighting that war since this very day. I have been wanting to get her back for all of these years, no idea where she went, not even sure if she perished. I have been retaining this for so long.
    But no matter. This is the day we win. This is what we want. This is our choice. We can fight against this madness, this control. We are strong.
    And we want a revolution.
    So who’s with me?`,

But alas, Lord Mirz pays quite well and we set off on the 16th of January. Mirz has tasked us with finding another lost expedition that had not returned from their scouting. He said that he’d pay for a report on the expeditionary force’s current situation. I know not of what has happened to them but I can only hope that they are still alive.

    *January 19:* Our runners found what was left of them. They were a few miles west of the campsite. There was but one survivor. The other men had died in rather odd circumstances. They had looked like they’ve been starved for weeks, their skin was wrapped tightly around their bones, so much so that their rib cages were easily visible. The one survivor was reportedly kneeling down and crying with tears visibly frozen to his face. We brought him back to camp and fed and watered him. He looked barely alive. He had an odd glassy look in his eyes and looked like the dead men from earlier. I cannot imagine the horrors he had faced. The runners also reported seeing robed figures in their periphery.

    *January 20:* The sodding bastard ran away. When we woke up he had left camp. Our runners started following the footprints but the blizzard had strengthened and we could not afford to lose more men. All I found was a scrap of paper on his cot, in which I shall attach to this page.
    Oh it was magnificent! The blasted men wouldn’t believe me! That’s why they fell. I remember being transported to a lush grove. A little girl took me by the hand and led me through the beautiful place! She pulled an apple from a tree that was as golden as a king’s crown and sweeter than the finest honey! Oh how I long to be back in that amazing place. The grove is out there. I need to find it. The grove. The grove. The grove.

Hidden within one of their ancient citadels, a trove of finely crafted daggers hibernates beneath the rubble, humming with an energy untouched for millennia. They called it, The Arsenal, and it is was this arsenal that gave the Gray Legion the power to assume control over the Central Archipelago.
    A few accounts detail the usage of this weapon. Through sheer force of will, one can cast the blades into a mighty storm that rains down upon your foes in a violent downpour of steel. With a little finesse, the blades become an assassin's best friend, flying through the air with deadly grace to deliver a swift and precise execution.
    I have sold few relics in my time, but those were mere pebbles at the shallow end of the pond. What secrets lie below those forgotten fortresses dates back to an era shrouded in mystery, untouched by the Storm's ruin and free from the strife of the factions. It is my duty to discover those secrets before the world does, for who knows what cataclysm they will bring about with such cursed knowledge.”

    26 days. 26 days until the attack. I knew I could trust her as much as the others. That Ironclad skirmish a week ago was pitiful. Only a fool would go after such a Lady. There’s only one other way to be a more incompetent imbecile, and that’s attempting to rise an army, a revolution, a likemind against her likeness. Lucky for me, I’ll never stray from her path. I’ll always know who is correct and who is incorrect, crystal clear.
    The plan is simple: a blitzkrieg on a Tribe. Their poison wouldn’t be enough to defeat us when we move quicker than it to our cores. It’s quite humorous, really, how they call themselves “Tribes”, while they very well know how much power they truly hold. That amount of concentrated mana in those many toads… mmm, cannon fodder is one of my favorite meals.
    18 more days. We line the streets, each unknowing of what will come of us in the end of this war. We watch the proper Frosthexers float down the Commons, hear the clean-shaven Rockworkers cheer with each other in near pubs.
    I wonder how freedom feels…
    “Hm?” Looking to the left and right quickly, confused to where the voice came from. I shake my head. Probably the cold getting to my core again.
    11 more days. Our preparations are ready. We train with our sparkrods. We do not hold back because we know how easily we can refund each other’s mana. We laugh in the face of the beaked training dummies, snapping off their tarred feathers. “Avimposters”, we call them.
    Do we have a say against it?
    I whip around, only to find my next opponent flinging a cheap shot at my face.
    3 more days. We are a nomadic army. We float over the islands, traveling to our goal. The spires luminesce in the distance.
    We are here.
    We round the back. Our sparkrods at our sides.
    “READY.”
    We breathe deep.
    “VORWÄRTS!”
    Her cry forces us all forwards. Speeding across the battlefield as a unified mind, small toads line up for us. We mow them down like small pebbles. They fear us, running from us-

Explosions and screaming deafen me. That was long ago. The iron legion keeps trying to take the fort. They fail every time. But with every attack, we lose more good men and women. The general said we would get reinforcements. We did. Just not the ones we had hoped for. They were like me those many years ago. Excited, brave, bold and stupid. They came in the giant doors of the keep, smiles on their faces. They thought that they were ready. Fresh suits of steel. Polished lances. They wanted to hunt an awful enemy. They didn’t know how brutal the enemy truly was. A small group was given to me. Just 12 soldiers, ready for combat. I sent 7 on a patrol. Just a simple patrol. How hard could that be? You just walk around looking out for shady business. Only two came back. It was 3 days before they spoke a word. 5 to say anything coherent. I asked about the rest. Storn? “Decapitated” Oldren? “Left behind after a construct took out his leg.” Zythol? “Shrapnel.” Ernst? They stopped speaking. They looked at the floor. They didn’t stop. The bodies were as bad as they described. But the blood, death and  decay wasn’t the worst part. It was the notes. Addressed to loved ones. Detailing their adventure. You can’t even look at their desecrated corpses after reading those. The next time they passed through the doors, they did not wear smiles, they wore nothing. It was a miracle that the two survived. It was an ambush. The rats laid dynamite on the road, and set it off when they passed. The constructs made quick work of the ones still standing. A week later more reinforcements arrived. They wore the same happy smiles as the ones before. And just like before, they’d fall.`,

    It was long ago when the dragons arrived. They were awoken from their slumber deep beneath the world. First it was terror. Horrid scenes of destroyed outposts, towns, caravans and most of all, people. But then… it was something else that the leaders saw in the dragons. Ferocious, cunning, bold and deadly. It seemed like a sound solution. The first few were horrible failures. Some might call them abominations. A few exploded under the intense power of construct conduits. The project was to create a specimen that perfectly represented the rodents. Intelligence was a big factor in the manipulation of their genome. When Specimen A-1 was created, the board was ecstatic. All it took was a couple months of experimenting and they were “field ready” as Doctor Mia put it. The first few combat dragons were brutal. Upon observation, it was discovered that they grow increasingly stronger when attacking. The green fire bellowed out of the hungry mouths with such intensity that it melted solid steel. Their angered yelps caused nearby dragons to attack with ferocity previously unheard. Some of which rivaled the toads. But the creatures are only a stepping stone in biological manipulation.

    Apparently there’s been a “big project” that just came into light. One to make dragons even more powerful. I remain doubtful. Only incredibly powerful dragons can even attempt to be merged with Union technology. Look at incident report 56-2. That was a messy day.`,

    Four.
    Four strength in me.
    Five.
    That’s how many days until that quadrupedal life force decays completely.
    The Wilds are a brutal troop. You have to sap off each other to survive, which the ravens are quite fond of doing to the toads.
    Which is why I’ve learned their tricks.
    When you want to steal a weakling’s energy, mana, body, you have to show yourself and it that you’re claiming it.
    Draining its power and using it as steroids.
    I learned that I had to be strong to survive when I was nearly blinded by my raven captor. I was used as a lumberjack, chopping at small, brittle trees. Day in, day out, all I had to eat was bark and bugs.
    One day I realized some information: whenever the raven drained toadlings to keep its aging body going, it reverted back in just a few days. It might have something to keep itself alive, but what if I were to take it from them?
    And so I did. I hid the toadlings away, out of reach and scent of the raven. An old log rotting away, one that I attempted hiding in to escape. The raven scrambled around the next few days. Almost heart wrenching to see its muscles wither away.
    And on the last day, I wanted the last words it heard would be mine.
    “The weak become weaker.”
    Its vocal cords were too weak to vibrate as I turned its bones into meal.
    It felt so damn good to observe
    Taste
    Become
    Its carrion.
    The absent, hallow, shriveled powerless husk simply turned gaseous as it rose to the ceiling.
    … sniff, sniff…
    Hey, excuse me, warden.
    Remember that phrase I said?
    Seems like you’re becoming weak.
    And the weak become we—

    content: `Long ago, in our misty green swamps, the earth split open and released beasts of unknown power. Some of which, being us. Well, that story has been told plenty of times. But here’s one of our great green goddess. On one harsh summer day, a small outposts of toads was savagely attacked by mysterious creatures. One of the toads described them as vicious and green as the swamps. We ravens thought that it was just a tribe of feral toads that needed to be converted into our great clan, but they were not. You see, they were actually ancient beasts who lay dormant beneath the world. We gathered the rest of the toads and marched into the swamp with our soultrap puppets in hand. In the summer, the stagnant water would heat and evaporate into stinking vapor that choked the lungs of outsiders. It was why we thought they were toads in the first place. After about 6 hours we found it. A great sanctuary filled to the brim with rubble, trees and pulsating blue eggs, the likes of which didn’t resemble any toad or raven eggs. They were at least 4 toads tall. Just as we approached, a thunderous crack interrupted our search for the culprits. It was the breaking of trees. As we looked up we saw a great serpent rise from the brush. With a screech the eggs broke and revealed more green serpents. The poor toads fought valiantly, even if it was fruitless. We tried our puppets to no avail. We were surrounded. We were at the mercy of the dragons. And with a sharp, raspy voice, the great dragon boomed;
    “WHO DARES TO DISTURB MY NESTS”.
    “It was I. Your dragons have attacked one of our outposts.”
    “MY YOUNGLINGS SHALL GO WHERE THEY PLEASE. YOU WASTE YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIVES BY COMING HERE”
    “Wait! Please! Spare us!”
    “FOR WHAT REASON SHALL I ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR PATHETIC LIVES?”
    “If you kill us now, our leaders will wonder what has happened. They will send more and more scouts until they find the truth. Then, when they do, your nests will be destroyed. You will have nowhere to raise your young.”
    “hmm. You pose a fair point. But I cannot let you live without some sort of repayment for destroying some of the eggs and disturbing my slumber.”
    “I shall spare you if, you are willing to talk to your leaders about my presence. Oh and one thing. You have seen what has happened to your pathetic “outpost”. If you fail. I will let my legions of dragons hunt you down.”
    At that moment, hundreds of green serpents surround us. Their hungry eyes show no remorse.
    So we talked to our great priestess Klaxi for some payment to the new dragon. Whilst the priestess loathes to show weakness, she could not afford another costly war. We devised a new solution. We would construct a new sacrificial totem near the nest. During the sacrifice, we would make sure that some toads got lost in the swamps. The dragons would eat the stray toads. After the sacrifices we told the toads that the bodies would be taken to a great tomb built in the heart of the swamp. But it was not a tomb. It was the nest. And sometimes when the blood price was paid, she would appear on the battlefield and lay waste to all of our enemies, for if they were to defeat us, there would be less toads to be used as nourishment. We made a great alliance. And, we had plenty of toads to spare.`,

If there was anyone in the world who loved gambling the most it was Snake Eyes. Snake eyes would always be found in the cafeteria, playing cards, dice or any other game he could get his hands on. Snake Eyes hosted this little game he liked to call “The Lottery of Blood” in which every crew member would be assigned a unique 4-digit number. Snake Eyes would then roll 4 dice. The member who had the closest number, would lead the next raid. The next closest numbers were the rest of the raid party. The addition of members only stopped when the captain felt they had enough men and women for the raid. “It’s fair” Snake Eyes once said. Sure, but only considering that Snake Eyes would remove his name from the pot and sometimes use special red weighted die. If you account for that, by all means it was fair.
    Pirates never played fair. It’s not in their nature. It’s why people become pirates. They don’t want to live by rules. They want to be free. It just so happens that being free comes with a cost. I’m planning to leave. I need to get out of this wretched place. I need t-

    And they were happy.
    But happiness always comes with a price, it seems.
    They needed more to add to the Herds. They got greedy. Necromancer’s Dichotomy, they were calling it. The mother endorsed it. The father, however, did not. He believed the dead were meant to rest. To have served in our war and then rest forever. But the mother wouldn’t listen to his pleads. She was obsessed with power, the brother was wrangled by her, and the princess? Too naïve to have known what was coming.

    I light the fuse of one of the dynamite, lobbing the stick at the left Delegator. Cracking cement exploded into a pillar of dust around it. The bot collapses on the ground, a small red circle with an x in the center appearing under its helm. One down.
    Didn’t seem like the other one liked that, though. A large bolt comes flying at the back of my head. Didn’t even know they could use themselves as projectiles, but it definitely hurt. Blood flowed slowly out, distorienting me. I couldn’t let myself get caught…
    I lit the second stick quickly and tossed it back, lodging itself in between a bolt on its shoulder and its head. Ssss….

    The bot was knocked over to the side, but not off its feet. I looked back at it, and it… it wasn’t moving? I stood up slowly and looked into its visor.

    I couldn’t see it, but I could hear the factory crumble. The metal bits falling off the edges, the steel beams’ rending screeches. A cacophony oddly beautiful.
    And the bots were gone.
    But now what? I failed the plan. I got myself stuck on this small chunk of land. Unless you’ve got an idea?

Victims of war and sacrifice left to rot at the bottom of the lakebed for eternity, their stories forever silenced by Death's cold, ominous whisper. Alas, some stories refuse to die, forever shambling on as husks of a memory best left forgotten. Searching for a soul with whom they can share their story with, before crumbling to ash.”

    title: 'Transportation',
    content: `Dear Sir Edrik,
    I have been preparing for your speech to the new  recruits, and I even added in important information about cleanliness and personal hygiene. (the veterans don't set the best of examples in those regards.)

    ---

    As for your questions concerning modes of transport, I do have some information for you, however you must understand that under no circumstances can we let this information leak. There is a reason that we never speak on it.

    ---

    You likely already know that, our units (or what's left of our units) travel via heat powered airships.
    These airships are very effective; we can travel to any of the nearest islands within 10 days. Although the airships can travel long distances without much fuel, we do tend to require anywhere from 3-6 mana to get us to our destination, but that is mana well spent compared to the alternatives.

    ---

    Now before I continue, I need remind you that this is for you only, your words inspire the soldiers, but some information will do the opposite.

    ---

    The Iornclad Union has a history of powerful flying machines. The technology that we use was actually an old blueprint smuggled from an Iornclad factory. Take special notice of the word old. The Union has always been bent on progress, and although some of it can hardly be seen as anything more than communism, they have made genuine progress when it comes to airships. We suspect they have figured out how to harness the wind, making their airships very strong. Most are capable of carrying large forces of constructs.

    ---

    As you've probably noticed, the satyrs and undeads of the east don't fly in on large machines. Although we have no clear answer, we suspect that they use a form of summoning magic. (Likely similar to the magic they use to raise the dead.) This, of course, is why they seem to appear out of nowhere, swarming the battlefield before we've even made a move.

    ---

    Now, we come to the winter pact. More specifically: the frostlings. Now, from what I've been told, the frostlings are made of mana…? (One with mana…?) All the information I have is from our spies and professors, and although I don't really understand it, I think they basically said: "blah blah blah, together, blah blah, mana, blah blah, control magic" (or something like that.) Really, all we know is they use mana to transport themselves and their fellow dwarves to where they need to be.

    ---

    Now, Sir Edrik, the tribes of Shadowfen are often seen leaving their natural habitat by way of flight. The Ravens carry themselves and their toads to the battlefield, although as I'm sure you've noticed, the Ravens tend to drop the toads before making a full landing. The ravens do have decent flight power, but it doesn't rival the powerful flight of the dragons.

    ---

    I do, Master Edrik, hope that you have found this information satisfactory. I will continue to do my best in training our newest recruits, they sure are a handful, but with my expertise, they will be skilled warriors in no time.
    Sincerely,

    — Your loyal servent`,

    content: `As the village doctor I find myself in all types of situations. A brick dropped on a foot, some sort of infection, telling some of the farmers that coughing isn’t caused by demons, the list goes on. But it was a certain day that we had a small raiding party try to destroy a grain silo. Luckily our guard was quick to sound the bell and the toads were swiftly dispatched. But it was not the fighting that worried me, it was the end. A small group of toads (about 7-9) was surrounded by 5 members of the village guard. The toads then began to shake violently. Their skin turned a deep purple. Their skin churned and bubbled like water in a cauldron. Then, they burst. Purple blood, guts and viscera covered the guards. First it was disgust but then it turned into relieved laughter. All seemed fine. Everyone went back to their lives. It was two days after the attack when I was regularly visited by the members of the guard. They all reported the same symptoms. Slight fever and an odd purple rash, the likes of which I had never seen before. They said that the rash “tingled”. I didn’t think anything of it. Probably just some form of the cold. I gave them each an ointment used to treat forms of Poison Ivy. But it escalated. It was not just a faint tingling. It was sharp, painful, crawling. Some of their limbs that were exposed to the entrails were now completely purple. Some poor soul’s face turned purple. Clearly it was now a situation worth investigating. A day later the victims reported paralysis in affected limbs. The man with the purple face could no longer speak, eat, drink or move his head in any way. The next it became extreme nausea and intense vomiting. The vomit was a deep purple now. When they bled, they bled purple. The whites of their eyes were faint purple. Their skin was tinged purple. Then, they died. The bodies were quickly burned in fear of the spreading of this new plague. It seemed that even in death, the violence of toads knew no bounds.`,

    title: 'About the Unbound',
    content: `Dear Sir Edrik,

    The new recruits have been trained and are ready to see first combat. I have confidence in these few, they seem rather gifted.
    ---
    Although your speech went in depth about personal hygiene, the veterans have been refusing to fight while the daily bath mandate is in place. I think we might be able to satisfy their demands if we change the restriction to weekly.
    ---
    Now, I have gone out of my way to find answers to your questions concerning the “unbound”. Our research has brought about very few answers, however new discoveries are always possible so I will keep a portion of my team studying the matter.
    I guess I should clarify who I’m talking about in case you don’t remember your previous letter, I know you are a busy man. I am using the term “unbound” to refer to the commanders seemingly not of this world. The ones that appear out of nowhere and disappear just the same.
    The first question we sought to answer was that of motivation. Of course, you are aware that they don't demand payment for their assistance, even though they use masterful tactics to assist our keeping of order and territory battles. We have, however, noticed that after every battle, the winner claims a portion of money, although we don’t know if this money comes from the enemy commander.
    We suspect that the unbound are motivated by prestige. Although we don’t know what they do with the money, we have noticed a correlation between each commander’s experience, and the troops abilities on the battlefield. I’m sure you have experienced this boost of power as well.
    The next place we searched for information was that of physical appearance. The unbound don’t seem to make small talk, even though they wear their titles proudly. They do however, as we have noticed, make gestures specifically targeted at the enemy commanders. Sometimes they seem friendly, sometimes formal, occasionally unpleasant.
    Concerning the names of the unbound, we have noticed that some commanders fight each other more frequently, sometimes even battling without their full power. This brings up motivation again, as it seems that they view full-scale battles as mear duels. To them, our territory disputes are games.
    Finally, we believe that the unbound have the power to talk to the “devs”, the ancient beings thought to control all of Stormbound. This is only theory though, we do not have solid evidence to back this up.
    ---
    With all this information, I ask of you Edrick, please train the unbound that are inexperienced in this world. I feel that our chances of bringing the world back to order are more reasonable when there are powerful leaders on all sides. Hopefully someday, the other kingdoms will see the pointlessness of our petty battles.
    Sincerely,

    — Your loyal servent`,

There, she met the love of her life — Edrik the Fierce. However, Edrik’s will was strong. No matter how much she played, he never once showed any affection towards her. He truly mesmerised her.

    Dried blood stained the grounds and a mix of rodent, dwarf and frostling corpses strewn on ground.The more bodies that fell, the angrier each side got, fueling their desire to win this war.
    Amidst the battlefield was a giant dwarf, the biggest the rodents had ever seen. He wielded 2 giant hammers, and it seemed that he was the one fixing the fortress every time it was damaged. They knew they needed to take him down, but for each hit they got on him, it felt like he was magically restored to full strength once more, no doubt the work of the famed arcane arts that the frostlings used.

    They were losing and they knew it. Slowly but surely they were being pushed back by smaller fortresses the dwarves were building and the giant dwarf that just kept getting stronger and stronger as the battle went on.

    That day, Queen Mia ordered the union’s troops to retreat and called off the war.

    In her throne room, a conversation between Queen Mia and General Raticus was held.
    “Forgive me, your majesty. They outnumbered us and we couldn’t take down the legendary Olf.”
    “Stand up,general. There is no need to kneel or to apologise,for we have won this war.”

    *A huge explosion, the structure trembles but the flaming red meteor hits its target*

    Dark
    Nothing

    I wake up.
    My head hurts, everything’s blurry… is someone yelling? Everything’s so dusty… what happened?
    All around me others keep moving forward, there’s sounds of fighting, the dusty battlefield trembles under the cacophony of explosions and clangs of iron against iron. Things start coming back: the deployment, the support from our heralds, the rush to the enemy’s outpost. Then we see them. They have cannons. Huge nasty towers that decimate anything that’s unfortunate enough to cross their path. I was one of those unfortunate soldiers. No, they can’t kill what’s already dead, I am still alive, I’m still here. They shot us point blank as we were running desperately to it, everyone else is dead but me… but me…
    Other ghouls rush beside me, they are just trying to get to the enemy’s base, they can’t help me, I’m alone. I finally stand up after those few seconds of confusion, and I look at it, I look at the stone walls and iron barrels that tower before me, thinking how many friends those cold objects they killed. Too many, but this ends now.
    I dash at the heavy steel doors, and I don’t even try to open them, instead I jump from the handles to reach with my scythe the top edge of the door frame and pull myself up with a swift movement. I don’t have much time, but I know I can do this.

    *Far away a white figure sees the survivor, their eyes open in terror, they yell orders to someone behind them.*

    I’m still climbing the tower, I’d be faster if I wasn’t alone and almost dead. There are many paneless windows to grab onto, and the few times there’s someone on the other side, their rodent head ends up rolling on the floor before they can even take out their little guns. I keep climbing, and climbing, and then it’s over. I’m at the top, finally over the last row of round holes and standing on the rounded roof, overlooking the whole battlefield. I see hordes of fauns being blown away by dynamite-wielding mice, only to be replaced by fellow undeads, scythe in hand, ready to vindicate the fallen.

    *The white figure is now on the battlefield, small, holding its gown to walk faster. As it gets close to the artillery, the whirring inside gets louder, and the cogs start spinning on its own*

    Suddenly the huge barrel starts moving, and slowly it places itself directly looking at our base. I don’t have time anymore! Someone must have survived, and they are now going to shoot us! This cannot be happening, I have to destroy this now! As the metal starts glowing hot red, I focus and hold my scythe upright. I close my eyes.

    Remember what the Queen taught you.

    *The white mouse is close enough now*

    Remember the fallen, the ones that now have to live again

    *It hold up its hand, crackles in its finger*

    Remember how they shattered the truce that held the kingdom together

    *The gunpowder is there, the bullet is waiting*

    Remember the pain of dying

    *snap*

    *Too late*

    As I’m raptured in my pain, I tap the back of the scythe on the roof of the structure. Suddenly the stones under my feet are crying for help, suddenly the iron beams can feel my pain, suddenly the foundations realize the weight they have been carrying all this time. The tower shudders in that instant, in a mix of horror and bewilderment, in that instant that it realizes it’s alive. And just as it was alive, it dies, because life was never meant to be forcefully infused in those old bricks, and as it dies everything crumbles, everything runs from itself, in the fear of feeling again, in the fear of fearing, of feeling. All it’s left is dust, dust that will always try to forget that instant, that moment where it could realize what it was.

    And as the dust cloud settles, I am still standing there, my eyes now open, in front of that damned white mouse, and their damned magic fingers, and their damned grin. It’s all their fault, all of this! They will pay! They will!
    My tired feet get ready to dash then they bump something unusual in the sand. I look down and squint. It’s a bottle filled with green liquid.As I pick it up I wonder: how is this here? Chance? Magic? The Gods?
    It does not matter now. Nothing matters.
    The mouse drops their smirk, watching me in horror as I down the liquid in one go.
    This ends with me, right here, right now.`,
