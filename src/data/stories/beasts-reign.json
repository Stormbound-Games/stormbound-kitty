  "content": "“My velvet skin as my coverin’,\nI will fight for all my kin,\nAs I brush through the desert sand,\nI trek this land with my axe in hand.\n---\nThe multitude grows evermore,\nSprouting fear in my very soul.\nWhen I see through the waves of dust,\nA glowing staff and a battle lust.\n---\nI carry on with the battle song,\nA prize of seeing this cruel world gone,\nMy body may lay down to rest,\nA grave adorn with this monster’s head.\n---\nThis mighty beast might meet its end,\nAgainst a frog with a velvet skin,\nBut mark these words of my strugglin’,\nThis endless beast will reign again.”",
