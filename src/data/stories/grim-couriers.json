  "content": "The undead are a gifted species in this world, bound by the storm. Theirs is a body lacking in muscle. Because of this, they're light and unrelenting, fatiguing only in the most hellish of circumstances. The couriers transcend this, never stopping to rest, allowing them to travel a month's journey in mere days. The greatest recorded incident, a two month trek to the wintery tundra performed in three days and nights. Few undead ever join the couriers in battle, and they'll always be one step ahead; or a thousand.",
