The herald song booms\n    Undead lurch from underground tombs\n    From the curse of death, life reborn\n    Beings cast from bone, soul and horn\n    As the goatmen charge and the queen weeps\n    Our skeletal army begins to reap\n    Scythes, Spears and battlecries\n    Meet to create an untimely demise\n    Decay ceases\n    Bloodshed increases\n    A final charge\n    Deathtoll large\n    A finishing strike\n    Flesh meeting pike\n    For all who meet their untimely doom\n    Will soon awake to an undead fate\n    Where the dark and the gloom\n    Forge an unrivaled hate\n    For this is the message\n    There is victory in undying\n    Death is not the end\n    It is merely the beginning ",
