You called me *delirious*! \n  “That’s not wh-“\n  “Not what? You left me alone.”\n  \n  The traitor had nothing to say as I closed in, only looking filled with the guilt he should feel, and as he flew onto the alter, *I realised I had no choice.*\n  \n  I mustered all of my breath… and Tegor was gone, nothing more than dust.\n  \n  …\n  \n  It must be preserved.\n  Tegor’s legacy will not be forgotten, not while I still breath the same air and walk the same ground as him.

You’re tra-“\n  \n  *DON’T LISTEN DON’T LISTEN DON’T LISTEN GO TO THE ALTER PROTECT THE GROVE*\n  \n  I dashed and burrowed as far as I could to get away, to protect the alter.\n  I eventually emerged where the great Crystal of Life stood, presumably keeping me safe from the outside world.\n  \n  “This isn’t fear….”\n  “I’m not afraid….”\n  “I need to be strong to save the Grove.”\n  \n  “There’s no one here to save. What are y-“\n  \n  I swiftly interrupted the voice\n  \n  “I am nothing without the Grove. *I am not safe without the Grove.*” \n  \n  *You must confront your foe. You’re strong enough to confront your foe. Look at the ceiling.*\n  \n  I looked up… there was… no ceiling… just… *an enemy.*\n  \n  It was nothing like anything I’ve seen before, a being with many arms that shimmered like the alter, floating with flowing crystals, and with eyes like full moons.\n  \n  “Why do you trust it?”\n  \n  *This is a test of your loyalty.*\n  \n  I swiftly broke off a row of icicles from a pillar with my tail and sent them hurling towards my enemy, who only caught them in her hands and dropped them.\n  \n  Why isn’t she fighting back?\n  \n  *Remember, this is only a test of your devotion. She didn’t fight back because I would never hurt you, because without you the Grove is nothing. The Grove needs you.*\n  \n  The Being seemed distracted for a moment and quickly looked back to me, seemingly considering her next move.\n  “You aren’t going to harm the alter, are you? No, you’re going back where you came from. I can’t afford to lose anything else.”\n  \n  “Is it really you who can’t afford to lose anything else?”\n  \n  *Yes, yes it is, witho-*\n  \n  “You call this place the Grove, but this place is dead. There are no trees left, no one here but you. You’re alone.”\n  \n  “I- I have the Grove with me, I’m not… alone.”\n  *Your loyalty stands strong, and because of that, so do you.*\n  \n  “You treat the Grove like it’s alive, with a mind of its own. But there’s no life left. Nothing but that crystal.”\n  \n  “If I stay loyal to the Crystal of Life I’ll be spared death.” I said, increasingly lightheaded.\n  “Everyone else abandoned… the… Grove….”\n  The Being soon finished my sentence as my mind went numb and blank, filled with the sounds of wind in leaves and conversations long past….\n  \n  “Because the Grove steals life to keep itself alive.”\n  ",
