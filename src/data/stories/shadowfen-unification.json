  "content": "It was long ago, in the swamps lived many tribes of ravens and toads. All the tribes were separated from each other without order. This was a chaotic place where fights broke out often. However, one raven saw to bring all the under one banner, Klaxi. She began by sacrificing the weakest toads that hatched, due to their fast reproductive cycle. When Klaxi built her army of ravens, she went on to sacrifice other toads and converting ravens with help of the Blood Ministers and Clerics with Cords. Soon, Klaxi reigned as the High Priestess of the Shadowfen.",
