  "content": "The trueshot posts are monumental defensive posts, shaped in memory of an unknown knight of veritable legend, who roamed the frontier and islands with his great warbow, shooting down the biggest game the storm could possibly offer, creatures of legend — dragons. Word spread of this legend like the snow on a midwinter night. Edrik’s high command caught wind of this legend, and devised this defensive post to take the heat off the nightwatch and to remind knights out in the field that the marksman of legend watches over them in their finest hours.",
